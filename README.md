| **[Prediction uncertainty-aware planning using deep ensembles and trajectory optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10585v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion is stochastic and ensuring safe robot navigation in a pedestrian-rich environment requires proactive decision-making. Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |

Although effective for accurate visual odometry in complex scenarios, these methods discard crucial information about moving objects. By incorporating this information into a Dynamic SLAM framework, the motion of dynamic entities can be estimated, enhancing navigation whilst ensuring accurate localization. However, the fundamental formulation of Dynamic SLAM remains an open challenge, with no consensus on the optimal approach for accurate motion estimation within a SLAM pipeline. Therefore, we developed DynoSAM, an open-source framework for Dynamic SLAM that enables the efficient implementation, testing, and comparison of various Dynamic SLAM optimization formulations. DynoSAM integrates static and dynamic measurements into a unified optimization problem solved using factor graphs, simultaneously estimating camera poses, static scene, object motion or poses, and object structures. We evaluate DynoSAM across diverse simulated and real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art motion estimation in indoor and outdoor environments, with substantial improvements over existing systems. Additionally, we demonstrate DynoSAM utility in downstream applications, including 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and trajectory prediction, thereby showcasing potential for advancing dynamic object-aware SLAM systems. DynoSAM is open-sourced at https://github.com/ACFR-RPG/DynOSAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 10 figures. Submitted to T-RO Visual SLAM SI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Integration Strategies in Autonomous Vehicle Prediction and Planning: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10477v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This comprehensive survey examines the integration of knowledge-based approaches into autonomous driving systems, with a focus on trajectory prediction and planning. We systematically review methodologies for incorporating domain knowledge, traffic rules, and commonsense reasoning into these systems, spanning purely symbolic representations to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. In particular, we analyze recent advancements in formal logic and differential logic programming, reinforcement learning frameworks, and emerging techniques that leverage large foundation models and diffusion models for knowledge representation. Organized under a unified literature survey section, our discussion synthesizes the state-of-the-art into a high-level overview, supported by a detailed comparative table that maps key works to their respective methodological categories. This survey not only highlights current trends -- including the growing emphasis on interpretable AI, formal verification in safety-critical systems, and the increased use of generative models in prediction and planning -- but also outlines the challenges and opportunities for developing robust, knowledge-enhanced autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Trajectory Predictors Without Ground-Truth Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08957v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework capable of accurately and smoothly estimating position, heading, and velocity. Using this high-quality input, we propose a system based on Trajectron++, able to consistently generate precise trajectory predictions. Unlike conventional models that require ground-truth data for training, our approach eliminates this dependency. Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments. Accurate estimations are crucial for deploying trajectory prediction models in real-world scenarios, and our system ensures meaningful and reliable results across various application contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. The code will be open sourced after the letter is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[Poly-Autoregressive Prediction for Modeling Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08646v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a simple framework for predicting the behavior of an agent in multi-agent settings. In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks, such as language processing, our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end, we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling, which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core, PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens, each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes, we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations, trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles, and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone, PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios. The project website can be found at https://neerja.me/PAR/.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11172v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code is made publicly available: https://github.com/valeoai/MF_aWTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to ICRA2025</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End Predictive Planner for Autonomous Driving with Consistency Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08033v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental components for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditionally, these components have often been treated as separate modules, limiting the ability to perform interactive planning and leading to computational inefficiency in multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel unified and data-driven framework that integrates prediction and planning with a single consistency model. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates samples from high-dimensional, multimodal joint trajectory distributions of the ego and multiple surrounding agents, enabling end-to-end predictive planning. It effectively produces interactive behaviors, such as proactive nudging and yielding to ensure both safe and efficient interactions with other road users. To incorporate additional planning constraints on the ego vehicle, we propose an alternating direction method for multi-objective guidance in online guided sampling. Compared to diffusion models, our consistency model achieves better performance with fewer sampling steps, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. Experimental results on Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate our method's superiority in trajectory quality, constraint satisfaction, and interactive behavior compared to various existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Gaussian Process-driven Hidden Markov Models for Early Diagnosis of Infant Gait Anomalies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06334v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait analysis is critical in the early detection and intervention of motor neurological disorders in infants. Despite its importance, traditional methods often struggle to model the high variability and rapid developmental changes inherent to infant gait. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian Process (GP)-driven Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the complex temporal dynamics of infant gait cycles and enable automatic recognition of gait anomalies. We use a Multi-Output GP (MoGP) framework to model interdependencies between multiple gait signals, with a composite kernel designed to account for smooth, non-smooth, and periodic behaviors exhibited in gait cycles. The HMM segments gait phases into normal and abnormal states, facilitating the precise identification of pathological movement patterns in stance and swing phases. The proposed model is trained and assessed using a dataset of infants with and without motor neurological disorders via leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results demonstrate that the MoGP outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural networks in modeling gait dynamics, offering improved accuracy, variance explanation, and temporal alignment. Further, the predictive performance of MoGP provides a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, allowing confidence estimation in gait trajectory predictions. Additionally, the HMM enhances interpretability by explicitly modeling gait phase transitions, improving the detection of subtle anomalies across multiple gait cycles. These findings highlight the MoGP-HMM framework as a robust automatic gait analysis tool, allowing early diagnosis and intervention strategies for infants with neurological motor disorders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interaction-aware Conformal Prediction for Crowd Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06221v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During crowd navigation, robot motion plan needs to consider human motion uncertainty, and the human motion uncertainty is dependent on the robot motion plan. We introduce Interaction-aware Conformal Prediction (ICP) to alternate uncertainty-aware robot motion planning and decision-dependent human motion uncertainty quantification. ICP is composed of a trajectory predictor to predict human trajectories, a model predictive controller to plan robot motion with confidence interval radii added for probabilistic safety, a human simulator to collect human trajectory calibration dataset conditioned on the planned robot motion, and a conformal prediction module to quantify trajectory prediction error on the decision-dependent calibration dataset. Crowd navigation simulation experiments show that ICP strikes a good balance of performance among navigation efficiency, social awareness, and uncertainty quantification compared to previous works. ICP generalizes well to navigation tasks under various crowd densities. The fast runtime and efficient memory usage make ICP practical for real-world applications. Code is available at https://github.com/tedhuang96/icp.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WAFR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Analyzable Parameters Dominated Vehicle Platoon Dynamics Modeling and Analysis: A Physics-Encoded Deep Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08658v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled nonlinear vehicle platoon dynamics modeling plays a crucial role in predicting and optimizing the interactions between vehicles. Existing efforts lack the extraction and capture of vehicle behavior interaction features at the platoon scale. More importantly, maintaining high modeling accuracy without losing physical analyzability remains to be solved. To this end, this paper proposes a novel physics-encoded deep learning network, named PeMTFLN, to model the nonlinear vehicle platoon dynamics. Specifically, an analyzable parameters encoded computational graph (APeCG) is designed to guide the platoon to respond to the driving behavior of the lead vehicle while ensuring local stability. Besides, a multi-scale trajectory feature learning network (MTFLN) is constructed to capture platoon following patterns and infer the physical parameters required for APeCG from trajectory data. The human-driven vehicle trajectory datasets (HIGHSIM) were used to train the proposed PeMTFLN. The trajectories prediction experiments show that PeMTFLN exhibits superior compared to the baseline models in terms of predictive accuracy in speed and gap. The stability analysis result shows that the physical parameters in APeCG is able to reproduce the platoon stability in real-world condition. In simulation experiments, PeMTFLN performs low inference error in platoon trajectories generation. Moreover, PeMTFLN also accurately reproduces ground-truth safety statistics. The code of proposed PeMTFLN is open source.</p></details> |  |
| **[The $α$-Alternator: Dynamic Adaptation To Varying Noise Levels In Sequences Using The Vendi Score For Improved Robustness and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04593v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art dynamical models, such as Mamba, assume the same level of noisiness for all elements of a given sequence, which limits their performance on noisy temporal data. In this paper, we introduce the $\alpha$-Alternator, a novel generative model for time-dependent data that dynamically adapts to the complexity introduced by varying noise levels in sequences. The $\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible similarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the influence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of the dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This influence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all sequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the direction of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a sequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model relies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely, when the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is considered informative, and the $\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new input than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics. The $\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking and Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in sequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and improving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and forecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\alpha$-Alternator outperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across neural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codebase will be made available upon publication.

| **[CUQDS: Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v4)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Approximation-Based Trajectory Prediction and Tracking with 4D Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01357v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is vital for autonomous vehicles, yet LiDAR and camera-based methods degrade in adverse weather. Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.</p></details> | 6pages, 4 figures |
| **[Multi-Object Active Search and Tracking by Multiple Agents in Untrusted, Dynamically Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01041v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of both actively searching and tracking multiple unknown dynamic objects in a known environment with multiple cooperative autonomous agents with partial observability. The tracking of a target ends when the uncertainty is below a threshold. Current methods typically assume homogeneous agents without access to external information and utilize short-horizon target predictive models. Such assumptions limit real-world applications. We propose a fully integrated pipeline where the main contributions are: (1) a time-varying weighted belief representation capable of handling knowledge that changes over time, which includes external reports of varying levels of trustworthiness in addition to the agents; (2) the integration of a Long Short Term Memory-based trajectory prediction within the optimization framework for long-horizon decision-making, which reasons in time-configuration space, thus increasing responsiveness; and (3) a comprehensive system that accounts for multiple agents and enables information-driven optimization. When communication is available, our strategy consolidates exploration results collected asynchronously by agents and external sources into a headquarters, who can allocate each agent to maximize the overall team's utility, using all available information. We tested our approach extensively in simulations against baselines, and in robustness and ablation studies. In addition, we performed experiments in a 3D physics based engine robot simulator to test the applicability in the real world, as well as with real-world trajectories obtained from an oceanography computational fluid dynamics simulator. Results show the effectiveness of our method, which achieves mission completion times 1.3 to 3.2 times faster in finding all targets, even under the most challenging scenarios where the number of targets is 5 times greater than that of the agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Autonomous Robots</p></details> |
| **[Wizard of Shopping: Target-Oriented E-commerce Dialogue Generation with Decision Tree Branching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00969v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of conversational product search (CPS) is to develop an intelligent, chat-based shopping assistant that can directly interact with customers to understand shopping intents, ask clarification questions, and find relevant products. However, training such assistants is hindered mainly due to the lack of reliable and large-scale datasets. Prior human-annotated CPS datasets are extremely small in size and lack integration with real-world product search systems. We propose a novel approach, TRACER, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic and natural conversations for different shopping domains. TRACER's novelty lies in grounding the generation to dialogue plans, which are product search trajectories predicted from a decision tree model, that guarantees relevant product discovery in the shortest number of search conditions. We also release the first target-oriented CPS dataset Wizard of Shopping (WoS), containing highly natural and coherent conversations (3.6k) from three shopping domains. Finally, we demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of WoS via human evaluations and downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGDIAL 2024 but withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Neural ODEs for Gene Regulatory Network Discovery under Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02409v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern high-throughput biological datasets with thousands of perturbations provide the opportunity for large-scale discovery of causal graphs that represent the regulatory interactions between genes. Differentiable causal graphical models have been proposed to infer a gene regulatory network (GRN) from large scale interventional datasets, capturing the causal gene regulatory relationships from genetic perturbations. However, existing models are limited in their expressivity and scalability while failing to address the dynamic nature of biological processes such as cellular differentiation. We propose PerturbODE, a novel framework that incorporates biologically informative neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) to model cell state trajectories under perturbations and derive the causal GRN from the neural ODE's parameters. We demonstrate PerturbODE's efficacy in trajectory prediction and GRN inference across simulated and real over-expression datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Single-Step and Multi-Step Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17459v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory prediction is a critical time series task in aviation. While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DISC: Dataset for Analyzing Driving Styles In Simulated Crashes for Mixed Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00050v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling pre-crash scenarios is still a major challenge for self-driving cars due to limited practical data and human-driving behavior datasets. We introduce DISC (Driving Styles In Simulated Crashes), one of the first datasets designed to capture various driving styles and behaviors in pre-crash scenarios for mixed autonomy analysis. DISC includes over 8 classes of driving styles/behaviors from hundreds of drivers navigating a simulated vehicle through a virtual city, encountering rare-event traffic scenarios. This dataset enables the classification of pre-crash human driving behaviors in unsafe conditions, supporting individualized trajectory prediction based on observed driving patterns. By utilizing a custom-designed VR-based in-house driving simulator, TRAVERSE, data was collected through a driver-centric study involving human drivers encountering twelve simulated accident scenarios. This dataset fills a critical gap in human-centric driving data for rare events involving interactions with autonomous vehicles. It enables autonomous systems to better react to human drivers and optimize trajectory prediction in mixed autonomy environments involving both human-driven and self-driving cars. In addition, individual driving behaviors are classified through a set of standardized questionnaires, carefully designed to identify and categorize driving behavior traits. We correlate data features with driving behaviors, showing that the simulated environment reflects real-world driving styles. DISC is the first dataset to capture how various driving styles respond to accident scenarios, offering significant potential to enhance autonomous vehicle safety and driving behavior analysis in mixed autonomy environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dream to Drive with Predictive Individual World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16733v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is still a challenging topic to make reactive driving behaviors in complex urban environments as road users' intentions are unknown. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers great potential to learn a reactive policy by constructing a world model that can provide informative states and imagination training. However, a critical limitation in relevant research lies in the scene-level reconstruction representation learning, which may overlook key interactive vehicles and hardly model the interactive features among vehicles and their long-term intentions. Therefore, this paper presents a novel MBRL method with a predictive individual world model (PIWM) for autonomous driving. PIWM describes the driving environment from an individual-level perspective and captures vehicles' interactive relations and their intentions via trajectory prediction task. Meanwhile, a behavior policy is learned jointly with PIWM. It is trained in PIWM's imagination and effectively navigates in the urban driving scenes leveraging intention-aware latent states. The proposed method is trained and evaluated on simulation environments built upon real-world challenging interactive scenarios. Compared with popular model-free and state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning methods, experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/gaoyinfeng/PIWM</p></details> |
| **[Toward Safe Integration of UAM in Terminal Airspace: UAM Route Feasibility Assessment using Probabilistic Aircraft Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16599v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Urban Air Mobility (UAM) into airspace managed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) poses significant challenges, particularly in congested terminal environments. This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Modular Framework for Uncertainty Prediction in Autonomous Vehicle Motion Forecasting within Complex Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a modular modeling framework designed to enhance the capture and validation of uncertainty in autonomous vehicle (AV) trajectory prediction. Departing from traditional deterministic methods, our approach employs a flexible, end-to-end differentiable probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture. This modular design allows the encoder and decoder to be trained independently, enabling seamless adaptation to diverse traffic scenarios without retraining the entire system. Our key contributions include: (1) a probabilistic heatmap predictor that generates context-aware occupancy grids for dynamic forecasting, (2) a modular training approach that supports independent component training and flexible adaptation, and (3) a structured validation scheme leveraging uncertainty metrics to evaluate robustness under high-risk conditions. To highlight the benefits of our framework, we benchmark it against an end-to-end baseline, demonstrating faster convergence, improved stability, and flexibility. Experimental results validate these advantages, showcasing the capacity of the framework to efficiently handle complex scenarios while ensuring reliable predictions and robust uncertainty representation. This modular design offers significant practical utility and scalability for real-world autonomous driving applications.</p></details> |  |

Embedding physical knowledge into these models is crucial for achieving realistic and consistent outputs, a challenge often addressed by physics-informed machine learning. However, integrating physical knowledge with representation learning becomes difficult when dealing with high-dimensional observation data, such as images, particularly under conditions of incomplete or imprecise state information. To address this, we propose Physically Interpretable World Models, a novel architecture that aligns learned latent representations with real-world physical quantities. Our method combines a variational autoencoder with a dynamical model that incorporates unknown system parameters, enabling the discovery of physically meaningful representations. By employing weak supervision with interval-based constraints, our approach eliminates the reliance on ground-truth physical annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves the quality of learned representations while achieving accurate predictions of future states, advancing the field of representation learning in dynamic systems.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an adaptive deep Koopman predictive control framework (AdapKoopPC) for regulating mixed traffic flow. Firstly, a Koopman theory-based adaptive trajectory prediction deep network (AdapKoopnet) is designed for modeling HDVs car-following behavior. AdapKoopnet enables the representation of HDVs behavior by a linear model in a high-dimensional space. Secondly, the model predictive control is employed to smooth the mixed traffic flow, where the combination of the linear dynamic model of CAVs and linear prediction blocks from AdapKoopnet is embedded as the predictive model into the AdapKoopPC. Finally, the predictive performance of the prosed AdapKoopnet is verified using the HighD naturalistic driving dataset. Furthermore, the control performance of AdapKoopPC is validated by the numerical simulations. Results demonstrate that the AdapKoopnet provides more accuracy HDVs predicted trajectories than the baseline nonlinear models. Moreover, the proposed AdapKoopPC exhibits more effective control performance with less computation cost compared with baselines in mitigating traffic oscillations, especially at the low CAVs penetration rates. The code of proposed AdapKoopPC is open source.</p></details> |  |

We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.13431</p></details> |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets.

Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Explicit formulations often scale quadratically in $d$ unless additional knowledge about system properties, such as sparsity and symmetries, is available. In this work, we propose a linear approach, the multivariate occupation kernel method (MOCK), using the implicit formulation provided by vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The solution for the vector field relies on multivariate occupation kernel functions associated with the trajectories and scales linearly with the dimension of the state space. We validate through experiments on a variety of simulated and real datasets ranging from 2 to 1024 dimensions. MOCK outperforms all other comparators on 3 of the 9 datasets on full trajectory prediction and 4 out of the 9 datasets on next-point prediction.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 5 Figures, 5 Tables, to be published in IEEE Aeroconf 2025</p></details> |
| **[Social Processes: Probabilistic Meta-learning for Adaptive Multiparty Interaction Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01915v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adaptively forecasting human behavior in social settings is an important step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Most existing research in social forecasting has focused either on unfocused interactions, such as pedestrian trajectory prediction, or on monadic and dyadic behavior forecasting. In contrast, social psychology emphasizes the importance of group interactions for understanding complex social dynamics. This creates a gap that we address in this paper: forecasting social interactions at the group (conversation) level. Additionally, it is important for a forecasting model to be able to adapt to groups unseen at train time, as even the same individual behaves differently across different groups. This highlights the need for a forecasting model to explicitly account for each group's unique dynamics. To achieve this, we adopt a meta-learning approach to human behavior forecasting, treating every group as a separate meta-learning task. As a result, our method conditions its predictions on the specific behaviors within the group, leading to generalization to unseen groups. Specifically, we introduce Social Process (SP) models, which predict a distribution over future multimodal cues jointly for all group members based on their preceding low-level multimodal cues, while incorporating other past sequences of the same group's interactions. In this work we also analyze the generalization capabilities of SP models in both their outputs and latent spaces through the use of realistic synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extension paper to "Social Processes: Self-Supervised Meta-Learning over Conversational Groups for Forecasting Nonverbal Social Cues", by Raman et al.

Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions.

Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

Instead, human beings subconscious can constantly process and store vast amounts of information from their experiences, perceptions, and learning, allowing them to fulfill complex actions such as riding a bike, without consciously thinking about each. Inspired by this phenomenon in action neurology, we introduced subconscious robotic imitation learning (SRIL), wherein cognitive offloading was combined with historical action chunkings to reduce delays caused by model inferences, thereby accelerating task execution. This process was further enhanced by subconscious downsampling and pattern augmented learning policy wherein intent-rich information was addressed with quantized sampling techniques to improve manipulation efficiency.

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Datasets with fine-grained action labels for moving people in industrial environments with mobile robots are scarce, as most existing datasets focus on social navigation in public spaces. This paper introduces the TH\"OR-MAGNI Act dataset, a substantial extension of the TH\"OR-MAGNI dataset, which captures participant movements alongside robots in diverse semantic and spatial contexts. TH\"OR-MAGNI Act provides 8.3 hours of manually labeled participant actions derived from egocentric videos recorded via eye-tracking glasses. These actions, aligned with the provided TH\"OR-MAGNI motion cues, follow a long-tailed distribution with diversified acceleration, velocity, and navigation distance profiles. We demonstrate the utility of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act for two tasks: action-conditioned trajectory prediction and joint action and trajectory prediction. We propose two efficient transformer-based models that outperform the baselines to address these tasks. These results underscore the potential of TH\"OR-MAGNI Act to develop predictive models for enhanced human-robot interaction in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the the 20th edition of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI'25), which will be held in Melbourne, Australia on March 4-6, 2025.

Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |

In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

One of the core strategies for achieving this goal is to understand humans' intent--underlying psychological factors that govern their motion--by learning their reward functions, typically via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Despite significant progress in IRL, learning reward functions of multiple agents simultaneously in dense unstructured pedestrian crowds has remained intractable due to the nature of the tightly coupled social interactions that occur in these scenarios \textit{e.g.} passing, intersections, swerving, weaving, etc. In this paper, we present a new multi-agent maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for real world unstructured pedestrian crowds. Key to our approach is a simple, but effective, mathematical trick which we name the so-called tractability-rationality trade-off trick that achieves tractability at the cost of a slight reduction in accuracy. We compare our approach to the classical single-agent MaxEnt IRL as well as state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on several datasets including the ETH, UCY, SCAND, JRDB, and a new dataset, called Speedway, collected at a busy intersection on a University campus focusing on dense, complex agent interactions. Our key findings show that, on the dense Speedway dataset, our approach ranks 1st among top 7 baselines with >2X improvement over single-agent IRL, and is competitive with state-of-the-art large transformer-based encoder-decoder models on sparser datasets such as ETH/UCY (ranks 3rd among top 7 baselines).</p></details> |  |

To address these, we propose DrivePhysica, an innovative model designed to generate realistic multi-view driving videos that accurately adhere to essential physical principles through three key advancements: (1) a Coordinate System Aligner module that integrates relative and absolute motion features to enhance motion interpretation, (2) an Instance Flow Guidance module that ensures precise temporal consistency via efficient 3D flow extraction, and (3) a Box Coordinate Guidance module that improves spatial relationship understanding and accurately resolves occlusion hierarchies.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment.

However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

However, as the number of longitudinal markers increases, joint model estimation becomes more complex, leading to long computation times and convergence issues. This study introduces a novel two-stage Bayesian approach for variable selection in joint models, illustrated through a practical application. Methods: Our approach conceptualizes the analysis in two stages. In the first stage, we estimate one-marker joint models for each longitudinal marker related to the event, allowing for bias reduction from informative dropouts through individual marker trajectory predictions. The second stage employs a proportional hazard model that incorporates expected current values of all markers as time-dependent covariates. We explore continuous and Dirac spike-and-slab priors for variable selection, utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Results: The proposed method addresses the challenges of parameter estimation and risk prediction with numerous longitudinal markers, demonstrating robust performance through simulation studies. We further validate our approach by predicting dementia risk using the Three-City (3C) dataset, a longitudinal cohort study from France. Conclusions: This two-stage Bayesian method offers an efficient process for variable selection in joint modeling, enhancing risk prediction capabilities in longitudinal studies. The accompanying R package VSJM, which is freely available at https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/VSJM, facilitates implementation, making this approach accessible for diverse clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Most existing pedestrian crossing behavior models are trained and evaluated on datasets collected from a single country, overlooking differences between countries. To address this gap, we compared pedestrian road-crossing behavior at unsignalized crossings in Germany and Japan. We presented four types of machine learning models to predict gap selection behavior, zebra crossing usage, and their trajectories using simulator data collected from both countries. When comparing the differences between countries, pedestrians from the study conducted in Japan are more cautious, selecting larger gaps compared to those in Germany. We evaluate and analyze model transferability. Our results show that neural networks outperform other machine learning models in predicting gap selection and zebra crossing usage, while random forest models perform best on trajectory prediction tasks, demonstrating strong performance and transferability. We develop a transferable model using an unsupervised clustering method, which improves prediction accuracy for gap selection and trajectory prediction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian crossing behaviors in different countries and offer valuable insights into model transferability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 figures, 11 tables.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

The complex interactions brought by different relations between agents are a crucial reason that poses challenges to this task. Researchers have put much effort into designing a system using rule-based or data-based models to extract and validate the patterns between pedestrian trajectories and these interactions, which has not been adequately addressed yet. Inspired by how humans perceive social interactions with different level of relations to themself, this work proposes the GrouP ConCeption (short for GPCC) model composed of the Group method, which categorizes nearby agents into either group members or non-group members based on a long-term distance kernel function, and the Conception module, which perceives both visual and acoustic information surrounding the target agent. Evaluated across multiple datasets, the GPCC model demonstrates significant improvements in trajectory prediction accuracy, validating its effectiveness in modeling both social and individual dynamics. The qualitative analysis also indicates that the GPCC framework successfully leverages grouping and perception cues human-like intuitively to validate the proposed model's explainability in pedestrian trajectory forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, submitted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Another Vertical View: A Hierarchical Network for Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction via Spectrums](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05106v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the fast development of AI-related techniques, the applications of trajectory prediction are no longer limited to easier scenes and trajectories. More and more trajectories with different forms, such as coordinates, bounding boxes, and even high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements within a frame of trajectory, which we call ``Dimension-wise Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, and potential dimension-wise interactions are less concerned. In this work, we expand the trajectory prediction task by introducing the trajectory dimensionality $M$, thus extending its application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories. We first introduce the Haar transform as an alternative to Fourier transform to better capture the time-frequency properties of each trajectory-dimension. Then, we adopt the bilinear structure to model and fuse two factors simultaneously, including the time-frequency response and the dimension-wise interaction, to forecast heterogeneous trajectories via trajectory spectrums hierarchically in a generic way. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art methods on ETH-UCY, SDD, nuScenes, and Human3.6M with heterogeneous trajectories, including 2D coordinates, 2D/3D bounding boxes, and 3D human skeletons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436v2)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Loss Strategy for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction: Combining Off-Road, Diversity, and Directional Consistency Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19747v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is essential for the safety and efficiency of planning in autonomous vehicles. However, current models often fail to fully capture complex traffic rules and the complete range of potential vehicle movements. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces three novel loss functions: Offroad Loss, Direction Consistency Error, and Diversity Loss. These functions are designed to keep predicted paths within driving area boundaries, aligned with traffic directions, and cover a wider variety of plausible driving scenarios. As all prediction modes should adhere to road rules and conditions, this work overcomes the shortcomings of traditional "winner takes all" training methods by applying the loss functions to all prediction modes. These loss functions not only improve model training but can also serve as metrics for evaluating the realism and diversity of trajectory predictions. Extensive validation on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets with leading baseline models demonstrates that our approach not only maintains accuracy but significantly improves safety and robustness, reducing offroad errors on average by 47% on original and by 37% on attacked scenes. This work sets a new benchmark for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, offering substantial improvements in navigating complex environments.

We propose Predictive Spliner, a data-driven overtaking planner that learns the behavior of opponents through Gaussian Process (GP) regression, which is then leveraged to compute viable overtaking maneuvers in future sections of the racing track. Experimentally validated on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information to perceive the opponent, Predictive Spliner outperforms State-of-the-Art (SotA) algorithms by overtaking opponents at up to 83.1% of its own speed, being on average 8.4% faster than the previous best-performing method. Additionally, it achieves an average success rate of 84.5%, which is 47.6% higher than the previous best-performing method. The method maintains computational efficiency with a Central Processing Unit (CPU) load of 22.79% and a computation time of 8.4 ms, evaluated on a Commercial off-the-Shelf (CotS) Intel i7-1165G7, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications.

Accurate prediction of dissection trajectories is crucial for better decision-making, reducing intraoperative errors, and improving surgical training. Nevertheless, predicting these trajectories is challenging due to variable tumor margins and dynamic visual conditions. To address this issue, we create the ESD Trajectory and Confidence Map-based Safety Margin (ETSM) dataset with $1849$ short clips, focusing on submucosal dissection with a dual-arm robotic system. We also introduce a framework that combines optimal dissection trajectory prediction with a confidence map-based safety margin, providing a more secure and intelligent decision-making tool to minimize surgical risks for ESD procedures. Additionally, we propose the Regression-based Confidence Map Prediction Network (RCMNet), which utilizes a regression approach to predict confidence maps for dissection areas, thereby delineating various levels of safety margins. We evaluate our RCMNet using three distinct experimental setups: in-domain evaluation, robustness assessment, and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results show that our approach excels in the confidence map-based safety margin prediction task, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of only $3.18$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a regression approach for visual guidance concerning delineating varying safety levels of dissection areas. Our approach bridges gaps in current research by improving prediction accuracy and enhancing the safety of the dissection process, showing great clinical significance in practice.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning-based approaches - especially those utilizing transformer-based and generative models - have markedly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex, non-linear patterns in vehicle dynamics and traffic interactions, they frequently overlook detailed car-following behaviors and the inter-vehicle interactions critical for real-world driving applications, particularly in fully autonomous or mixed traffic scenarios. To address the issue, this study introduces a scaled noise conditional diffusion model for car-following trajectory prediction, which integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a generative framework, improving both the accuracy and plausibility of predicted trajectories. The model utilizes a novel pipeline to capture historical vehicle dynamics by scaling noise with encoded historical features within the diffusion process. Particularly, it employs a cross-attention-based transformer architecture to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies, effectively guiding the denoising process and enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.11941</p></details> |

These models help aircraft detect conflict and plan avoidance maneuvers, which is especially important in Unmanned Aircraft systems (UAS) landing management due to the congested airspace near vertiports. In this paper, we propose a landing trajectory prediction model for UAS based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is a prestigious neural network that has been developed for many years. In previous research, GAN has achieved many state-of-the-art results in many generation tasks. The GAN consists of one neural network generator and a neural network discriminator. Because of the learning capacity of the neural networks, the generator is capable to understand the features of the sample trajectory. The generator takes the previous trajectory as input and outputs some random status of a flight. According to the results of the experiences, the proposed model can output more accurate predictions than the baseline method(GMR) in various datasets. To evaluate the proposed model, we also create a real UAV landing dataset that includes more than 2600 trajectories of drone control manually by real pilots.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, AIAA SCITECH 2023</p></details> |

In this paper, we aim to learn the trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve its performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to predict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and can provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle the diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE (\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as \textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between parameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from large-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In addition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by learning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is explicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more flexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy conditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to train Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior performance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is scaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v2)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the relationship between Koopman operator approximations and neural ordinary differential equations for data-driven time-evolution predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12940v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work explores the relationship between state space methods and Koopman operator-based methods for predicting the time-evolution of nonlinear dynamical systems. We demonstrate that extended dynamic mode decomposition with dictionary learning (EDMD-DL), when combined with a state space projection, is equivalent to a neural network representation of the nonlinear discrete-time flow map on the state space. We highlight how this projection step introduces nonlinearity into the evolution equations, enabling significantly improved EDMD-DL predictions. With this projection, EDMD-DL leads to a nonlinear dynamical system on the state space, which can be represented in either discrete or continuous time. This system has a natural structure for neural networks, where the state is first expanded into a high dimensional feature space followed by a linear mapping which represents the discrete-time map or the vector field as a linear combination of these features. Inspired by these observations, we implement several variations of neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and EDMD-DL, developed by combining different aspects of their respective model structures and training procedures. We evaluate these methods using numerical experiments on chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system and a nine-mode model of turbulent shear flow, showing comparable performance across methods in terms of short-time trajectory prediction, reconstruction of long-time statistics, and prediction of rare events. We also show that these methods provide comparable performance to a non-Markovian approach in terms of prediction of extreme events.</p></details> |  |
| **[C$^{2}$INet: Realizing Incremental Trajectory Prediction with Prior-Aware Continual Causal Intervention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12313v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agents in complex scenarios is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. However, existing methods often overlook environmental biases, which leads to poor generalization. Additionally, hardware constraints limit the use of large-scale data across environments, and continual learning settings exacerbate the challenge of catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose the Continual Causal Intervention (C$^{2}$INet) method for generalizable multi-agent trajectory prediction within a continual learning framework. Using variational inference, we align environment-related prior with posterior estimator of confounding factors in the latent space, thereby intervening in causal correlations that affect trajectory representation. Furthermore, we store optimal variational priors across various scenarios using a memory queue, ensuring continuous debiasing during incremental task training. The proposed C$^{2}$INet enhances adaptability to diverse tasks while preserving previous task information to prevent catastrophic forgetting. It also incorporates pruning strategies to mitigate overfitting. Comparative evaluations on three real and synthetic complex datasets against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves reliable prediction performance, effectively mitigating confounding factors unique to different scenarios. This highlights the practical value of our method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Many existing trajectory prediction methods rely heavily on high-definition (HD) maps as strong driving priors. However, the availability and accuracy of these priors are not guaranteed due to substantial costs to build, localization errors of vehicles, or ongoing road constructions. In this paper, we introduce MFTP, a Map-Free Trajectory Prediction method that offers several advantages. First, it eliminates the need for HD maps during inference while still benefiting from map priors during training via knowledge distillation. Second, we present a novel hierarchical encoder that effectively extracts spatial-temporal agent features and aggregates them into multiple trajectory queries. Additionally, we introduce an iterative decoder that sequentially decodes trajectory queries to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset under the map-free setting.</p></details> |  |

World model-based Reinforcement Learning (WMRL) approaches offers a promising solution by simulating future states from current state and actions. However, utility of world models is often limited by typical RL policies being limited to deterministic or single gaussian distribution. By failing to capture the full spectrum of possible actions, reduces their adaptability in complex, dynamic environments. In this work, we introduce Imagine-2-Drive, a framework that consists of two components, VISTAPlan, a high-fidelity world model for accurate future prediction and Diffusion Policy Actor (DPA), a diffusion based policy to model multi-modal behaviors for trajectory prediction. We use VISTAPlan to simulate and evaluate trajectories from DPA and use Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) to train DPA to maximize the cumulative sum of rewards over the trajectories. We analyze the benefits of each component and the framework as a whole in CARLA with standard driving metrics. As a consequence of our twin novelties- VISTAPlan and DPA, we significantly outperform the state of the art (SOTA) world models on standard driving metrics by 15% and 20% on Route Completion and Success Rate respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Recent autonomous driving frameworks have focused on improving prediction accuracy to explicitly model these interactions. However, some methods overlook the significant influence of the ego vehicle's planning on the possible trajectories of other agents, which can alter prediction accuracy and lead to unsafe planning decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel motion Planning approach by Simulation with learning-based parallel scenario prediction (PS). PS deduces predictions iteratively based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), jointly inferring scenarios that cooperate with the ego vehicle's planning set. Our method simulates possible scenes and calculates their costs after the ego vehicle executes potential actions. To balance and prune unreasonable actions and scenarios, we adopt MCTS as the foundation to explore possible future interactions encoded within the prediction network. Moreover, the query-centric trajectory prediction streamlines our scene generation, enabling a sophisticated framework that captures the mutual influence between other agents' predictions and the ego vehicle's planning. We evaluate our framework on the Argoverse 2 dataset, and the results demonstrate that our approach effectively achieves parallel ego vehicle planning.</p></details> |  |

MFTIQ builds upon the flow-chaining concepts of MFT, integrating an Independent Quality (IQ) module that separates correspondence quality estimation from optical flow computations. This decoupling significantly enhances the accuracy and flexibility of the tracking process, allowing MFTIQ to maintain reliable trajectory predictions even in scenarios of prolonged occlusions and complex dynamics. Designed to be "plug-and-play", MFTIQ can be employed with any off-the-shelf optical flow method without the need for fine-tuning or architectural modifications. Experimental validations on the TAP-Vid Davis dataset show that MFTIQ with RoMa optical flow not only surpasses MFT but also performs comparably to state-of-the-art trackers while having substantially faster processing speed.

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

While modeling pairwise relations has been widely studied in multi-agent interacting systems, the ability to capture larger-scale group-wise activities is limited. In this paper, we propose a systematic relational reasoning approach with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction and social robot navigation. In addition to the edges between pairs of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-wise reasoning in an unsupervised manner. Our approach infers dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs to capture the evolution of relations, which the trajectory predictor employs to generate future states. Meanwhile, we propose to regularize the sharpness and sparsity of the learned relations and the smoothness of the relation evolution, which proves to enhance training stability and model performance. The proposed approach is validated on synthetic crowd simulations and real-world benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that the approach infers reasonable relations and achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance. In addition, we present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for social robot navigation, which incorporates relational reasoning and trajectory prediction systematically. In a group-based crowd simulation, our method outperforms the strongest baseline by a significant margin in terms of safety, efficiency, and social compliance in dense, interactive scenarios.

However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information. To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images. Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

While these models are known to mispredict in out-of-distribution interactions, only a subset of prediction errors impact downstream robot performance. We propose characterizing such "system-level" prediction failures via the mathematical notion of regret: high-regret interactions are precisely those in which mispredictions degraded closed-loop robot performance. We further introduce a probabilistic generalization of regret that calibrates failure detection across disparate deployment contexts and renders regret compatible with reward-based and reward-free (e.g., generative) planners. In simulated autonomous driving interactions and social navigation interactions deployed on hardware, we showcase that our system-level failure metric can be used offline to automatically extract closed-loop human-robot interactions that state-of-the-art generative human predictors and robot planners previously struggled with. We further find that the very presence of high-regret data during human predictor fine-tuning is highly predictive of robot re-deployment performance improvements. Fine-tuning with the informative but significantly smaller high-regret data (23% of deployment data) is competitive with fine-tuning on the full deployment dataset, indicating a promising avenue for efficiently mitigating system-level human-robot interaction failures.

However, the complexity of human motion have prevented the development of a standardized dataset for human motion prediction, thereby hindering the establishment of pre-trained models. In this paper, we address these limitations by integrating multiple datasets, encompassing both trajectory and 3D pose keypoints, to propose a pre-trained model for human motion prediction.

Such limitations can be exacerbated by nonlinear object motion, particularly from an ego-centric viewpoint. It becomes evident that to address these challenges, the key lies in exploiting temporal feature relation over an extended horizon and enforcing spatial motion consistency for effective association. To this end, this paper proposes SIRA (Scalable Inter-frame Relation and Association) with two designs. First, inspired by Swin Transformer, we introduce extended temporal relation, generalizing the existing temporal relation layer from two consecutive frames to multiple inter-frames with temporally regrouped window attention for scalability. Second, we propose motion consistency track with the concept of a pseudo-tracklet generated from observational data for better trajectory prediction and subsequent object association. Our approach achieves 58.11 mAP@0.5 for oriented object detection and 47.79 MOTA for multiple object tracking on the Radiate dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by a margin of +4.11 mAP@0.5 and +9.94 MOTA, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, Accepted to CVPR2024</p></details> |
| **[Metric Flow Matching for Smooth Interpolations on the Data Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14780v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matching objectives underpin the success of modern generative models and rely on constructing conditional paths that transform a source distribution into a target distribution. Despite being a fundamental building block, conditional paths have been designed principally under the assumption of Euclidean geometry, resulting in straight interpolations. However, this can be particularly restrictive for tasks such as trajectory inference, where straight paths might lie outside the data manifold, thus failing to capture the underlying dynamics giving rise to the observed marginals. In this paper, we propose Metric Flow Matching (MFM), a novel simulation-free framework for conditional flow matching where interpolants are approximate geodesics learned by minimizing the kinetic energy of a data-induced Riemannian metric. This way, the generative model matches vector fields on the data manifold, which corresponds to lower uncertainty and more meaningful interpolations. We prescribe general metrics to instantiate MFM, independent of the task, and test it on a suite of challenging problems including LiDAR navigation, unpaired image translation, and modeling cellular dynamics. We observe that MFM outperforms the Euclidean baselines, particularly achieving SOTA on single-cell trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing human data is crucial for developing autonomous systems that replicate safe driving practices and ensure seamless integration into human-dominated environments. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of human compliance with traffic and safety rules across multiple trajectory prediction datasets, including Argoverse 2, nuPlan, Lyft, and DeepUrban. By defining and leveraging existing safety and behavior-related metrics, such as time to collision, adherence to speed limits, and interactions with other traffic participants, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of each datasets strengths and limitations. Our analysis focuses on the distribution of data samples, identifying noise, outliers, and undesirable behaviors exhibited by human drivers in both the training and validation sets. The results underscore the need for applying robust filtering techniques to certain datasets due to high levels of noise and the presence of such undesirable behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, CoRL 2024 Workshop SAFE-ROL</p></details> |

In addition, we designed social constraints to ensure the safety of robot navigation. The proposed system is evaluated through physical simulation using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, demonstrating its superior performance in avoiding human and dynamic obstacles, thereby ensuring safe navigation.

| **[Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Safe Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving: A Transformer-Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01475v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical aspect of safe and efficient motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is to handle the complex and uncertain behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. In particular, world models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: 1) Generation of Future Physical World, covering image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; 2) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; 3) Interaction Between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, long-tail scenario generation, and multimodal fusion to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, our comprehensive analysis provides a theoretical framework and technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | Ongoing project |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Long-Term TalkingFace Generation via Motion-Prior Conditional Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09533v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in conditional diffusion models have shown promise for generating realistic TalkingFace videos, yet challenges persist in achieving consistent head movement, synchronized facial expressions, and accurate lip synchronization over extended generations. To address these, we introduce the \textbf{M}otion-priors \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MCDM}), which utilizes both archived and current clip motion priors to enhance motion prediction and ensure temporal consistency. The model consists of three key elements: (1) an archived-clip motion-prior that incorporates historical frames and a reference frame to preserve identity and context; (2) a present-clip motion-prior diffusion model that captures multimodal causality for accurate predictions of head movements, lip sync, and expressions; and (3) a memory-efficient temporal attention mechanism that mitigates error accumulation by dynamically storing and updating motion features. We also release the \textbf{TalkingFace-Wild} dataset, a multilingual collection of over 200 hours of footage across 10 languages. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in maintaining identity and motion continuity for long-term TalkingFace generation. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11172v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code is made publicly available: https://github.com/valeoai/MF_aWTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to ICRA2025</p></details> |
| **[Not All Frame Features Are Equal: Video-to-4D Generation via Decoupling Dynamic-Static Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08377v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it regards the portions of current frame features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features. Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it adaptively selects a similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D. In addition, the experiments on a real-world scenario dataset demonstrate its effectiveness on the 4D scene. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning. Code will be available at https://github.com/centiLinda/AToM-human-prediction.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Acquisition through My Eyes and Steps: A Joint Predictive Agent Model in Egocentric Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05857v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the task of learning an agent model behaving like humans, which can jointly perceive, predict, and act in egocentric worlds. Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, leading to information silos among them, which prevents these abilities from learning from each other and collaborating effectively. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions with a single transformer. EgoAgent unifies the representational spaces of the three abilities by mapping them all into a sequence of continuous tokens. Learnable query tokens are appended to obtain current states, future states, and next actions. With joint supervision, our agent model establishes the internal relationship among these three abilities and effectively mimics the human inference and learning processes. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent covering image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoJAM: Joint Appearance-Motion Representations for Enhanced Motion Generation in Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02492v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous recent progress, generative video models still struggle to capture real-world motion, dynamics, and physics. We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

| **[Bayesian Approximation-Based Trajectory Prediction and Tracking with 4D Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01357v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is vital for autonomous vehicles, yet LiDAR and camera-based methods degrade in adverse weather. Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.</p></details> | 6pages, 4 figures |
| **[FlexCloud: Direct, Modular Georeferencing and Drift-Correction of Point Cloud Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00395v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current software stacks for real-world applications of autonomous driving leverage map information to ensure reliable localization, path planning, and motion prediction. An important field of research is the generation of point cloud maps, referring to the topic of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). As most recent developments do not include global position data, the resulting point cloud maps suffer from internal distortion and missing georeferencing, preventing their use for map-based localization approaches. Therefore, we propose FlexCloud for an automatic georeferencing of point cloud maps created from SLAM. Our approach is designed to work modularly with different SLAM methods, utilizing only the generated local point cloud map and its odometry. Using the corresponding GNSS positions enables direct georeferencing without additional control points. By leveraging a 3D rubber-sheet transformation, we can correct distortions within the map caused by long-term drift while maintaining its structure. Our approach enables the creation of consistent, globally referenced point cloud maps from data collected by a mobile mapping system (MMS). The source code of our work is available at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FlexCloud.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at VEHITS 2025, Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Vehicle Technology and Intelligent Transport Systems - VEHITS; 2025</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming Semantic Dilution in Transformer-Based Next Frame Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16753v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-frame prediction in videos is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving, object tracking, and motion prediction. The primary challenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing both spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The transformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has made remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame prediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$ is the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original embeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in the latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models predict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves, but the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the predicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training objective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head Self-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic dilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce a loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the training objective more closely with the model output. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original transformer-based predictors.</p></details> |  |

Most recent studies have concentrated on generating motion sequences based on text prompts, commonly referred to as text-to-motion generation. However, the bidirectional generation of motion and text, enabling tasks such as motion-to-text alongside text-to-motion, has been largely unexplored. This capability is essential for aligning diverse modalities and supports unconditional generation. In this paper, we introduce PackDiT, the first diffusion-based generative model capable of performing various tasks simultaneously, including motion generation, motion prediction, text generation, text-to-motion, motion-to-text, and joint motion-text generation. Our core innovation leverages mutual blocks to integrate multiple diffusion transformers (DiTs) across different modalities seamlessly. We train PackDiT on the HumanML3D dataset, achieving state-of-the-art text-to-motion performance with an FID score of 0.106, along with superior results in motion prediction and in-between tasks. Our experiments further demonstrate that diffusion models are effective for motion-to-text generation, achieving performance comparable to that of autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches focus on minimising fuel consumption and emissions through greater autonomy. Efficient and safe autonomous navigation requires high-fidelity ship motion models applicable to real-world conditions. Although physics-based ship motion models can predict ships' motion with sub-second resolution, their validation in real-world conditions is rarely found in the literature. This study presents a physics-based 3D dynamics motion model that is tailored to a container-ship, and compares its predictions against real-world voyages. The model integrates vessel motion over time and accounts for its hydrodynamic behavior under different environmental conditions. The model's predictions are evaluated against real vessel data both visually and using multiple distance measures. Both methodologies demonstrate that the model's predictions align closely with the real-world trajectories of the container-ship.</p></details> |  |

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on three real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Existing methods may fall short due to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Multi-Subgraph GCN for 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00317v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction (HMP) involves forecasting future human motion based on historical data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

While most existing methods incorporate a reconstruction task as an auxiliary task into the decoder, thereby improving the modeling of spatio-temporal dependencies, they overlook the potential conflicts between reconstruction and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Temporal Decoupling Decoding with Inverse Processing (\textbf{$TD^2IP$}). Our method strategically separates reconstruction and prediction decoding processes, employing distinct decoders to decode the shared motion features into historical or future sequences. Additionally, inverse processing reverses motion information in the temporal dimension and reintroduces it into the model, leveraging the bidirectional temporal correlation of human motion behaviors. By alleviating the conflicts between reconstruction and prediction tasks and enhancing the association of historical and future information, \textbf{$TD^2IP$} fosters a deeper understanding of motion patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the adaptability of our method within existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Given that these long-tail events are extremely rare in real-world traffic data, there is a growing body of work dedicated to the automatic traffic scenario generation. However, nearly all existing algorithms for generating safety-critical scenarios rely on snippets of previously recorded traffic events, transforming normal traffic flow into accident-prone situations directly. In other words, safety-critical traffic scenario generation is hindsight and not applicable to newly encountered and open-ended traffic events.In this paper, we propose the Deep Motion Factorization (DeepMF) framework, which extends static safety-critical driving scenario generation to closed-loop and interactive adversarial traffic simulation. DeepMF casts safety-critical traffic simulation as a Bayesian factorization that includes the assignment of hazardous traffic participants, the motion prediction of selected opponents, the reaction estimation of autonomous vehicle (AV) and the probability estimation of the accident occur. All the aforementioned terms are calculated using decoupled deep neural networks, with inputs limited to the current observation and historical states. Consequently, DeepMF can effectively and efficiently simulate safety-critical traffic scenarios at any triggered time and for any duration by maximizing the compounded posterior probability of traffic risk. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepMF excels in terms of risk management, flexibility, and diversity, showcasing outstanding performance in simulating a wide range of realistic, high-risk traffic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.

| **[Joint Perception and Prediction for Autonomous Driving: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14088v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous driving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex environments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the environment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module is responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These modules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object tracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and optimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next. However, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are not shared across tasks, the lack of joint optimization can amplify errors as they propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated between modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these challenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged, integrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task learning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods, but also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data, allowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for autonomous driving. We propose a taxonomy that categorizes approaches based on input representation, scene context modeling, and output representation, highlighting their contributions and limitations. Additionally, we present a qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison of existing methods. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on identified gaps in the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 sections, 7 figures, 7 tables.

Although optimized in a planning-oriented spirit with a fully differentiable framework, existing end-to-end driving systems without ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, owing to the rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we revisit the human driving behavior and propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named DiFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, DiFSD mainly consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection, tracking and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. Besides, both position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thus facilitating the training stability and convergence of the whole framework. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superior planning performance and great efficiency of DiFSD.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Parallel Multi-scale Incremental Prediction (PMS), a novel framework that explicitly models incremental motion across multiple spatio-temporal scales to capture subtle joint evolutions and global trajectory shifts. PMS encodes these multi-scale increments using parallel sequence branches, enabling iterative refinement of predictions. A multi-stage training procedure with a full-timeline loss integrates temporal context. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in continuity, biomechanical consistency, and long-term forecast stability by modeling inter-frame increments. PMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, increasing prediction accuracy by 16.3%-64.2% over previous methods. The proposed multi-scale incremental approach provides a powerful technique for advancing human motion prediction capabilities critical for seamless human-robot interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Dual-Headway Unicycle Pose Control and Motion Prediction for Optimal Sampling-Based Feedback Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10350v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe, smooth, and optimal motion planning for nonholonomically constrained mobile robots and autonomous vehicles is essential for achieving reliable, seamless, and efficient autonomy in logistics, mobility, and service industries. In many such application settings, nonholonomic robots, like unicycles with restricted motion, require precise planning and control of both translational and orientational motion to approach specific locations in a designated orientation, such as for approaching changing, parking, and loading areas. In this paper, we introduce a new dual-headway unicycle pose control method by leveraging an adaptively placed headway point in front of the unicycle pose and a tailway point behind the goal pose. In summary, the unicycle robot continuously follows its headway point, which chases the tailway point of the goal pose and the asymptotic motion of the tailway point towards the goal position guides the unicycle robot to approach the goal location with the correct orientation. The simple and intuitive geometric construction of dual-headway unicycle pose control enables an explicit convex feedback motion prediction bound on the closed-loop unicycle motion trajectory for fast and accurate safety verification. We present an application of dual-headway unicycle control for optimal sampling-based motion planning around obstacles. In numerical simulations, we show that optimal unicycle motion planning using dual-headway translation and orientation distances significantly outperforms Euclidean translation and cosine orientation distances in generating smooth motion with minimal travel and turning effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 1 table, an extended version of a paper submitted for publication</p></details> |

Most existing methods focus on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions. For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop simulation, map prediction, and motion planning.

However, conventional MDC video codecs suffer from cumbersome architectures, poor scalability, limited loss resilience, and lower compression efficiency. As a result, MDC has never been widely adopted. Inspired by the potential of neural video codecs, this paper rethinks MDC design. We propose a novel MDC video codec, NeuralMDC, demonstrating how bidirectional transformers trained for masked token prediction can vastly simplify the design of MDC video codec. To compress a video, NeuralMDC starts by tokenizing each frame into its latent representation and then splits the latent tokens to create multiple descriptions containing correlated information. Instead of using motion prediction and warping operations, NeuralMDC trains a bidirectional masked transformer to model the spatial-temporal dependencies of latent representations and predict the distribution of the current representation based on the past. The predicted distribution is used to independently entropy code each description and infer any potentially lost tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate NeuralMDC achieves state-of-the-art loss resilience with minimal sacrifices in compression efficiency, significantly outperforming the best existing residual-coding-based error-resilient neural video codec.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Recent fine-tuning approaches focus on improving efficiency rather than accuracy by using a mixture of smaller learning rates or frozen backbones. To return the spotlight to model accuracy, we present PROFIT (Proximally Restricted Optimizer For Iterative Training), one of the first optimizers specifically designed for incrementally fine-tuning converged models on new tasks or datasets. Unlike traditional optimizers such as SGD or Adam, which make minimal assumptions due to random initialization, PROFIT leverages the structure of a converged model to regularize the optimization process, leading to improved results. By employing a simple temporal gradient orthogonalization process, PROFIT outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods across various tasks: image classification, representation learning, and large-scale motion prediction. Moreover, PROFIT is encapsulated within the optimizer logic, making it easily integrated into any training pipeline with minimal engineering effort. A new class of fine-tuning optimizers like PROFIT can drive advancements as fine-tuning and incremental training become increasingly prevalent, reducing reliance on costly model training from scratch.</p></details> | technical report |

Traditional approaches typically fall into two categories: object-centric and class-agnostic methods. While object-centric methods often struggle with missed detections, leading to inaccuracies in motion prediction, many class-agnostic methods focus heavily on encoder design, often overlooking important priors like rigidity and temporal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance, particularly with sparse LiDAR data at distant region. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{PriorMotion}$, a generative framework that extracts rasterized and vectorized scene representations to model spatio-temporal priors. Our model comprises a BEV encoder, an Raster-Vector prior Encoder, and a Spatio-Temporal prior Generator, improving both spatial and temporal consistency in motion prediction. Additionally, we introduce a standardized evaluation protocol for class-agnostic motion prediction. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that PriorMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance, with further validation on advanced FMCW LiDAR confirming its robustness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Owing to the non-uniqueness of the seismic inverse problem, typically many velocity models exist for any given region. The arbitrary choice of which velocity model to use in earthquake simulations impacts ground motion predictions. However, current hazard analysis methods do not account for this source of uncertainty. We present a proof-of-concept ground motion prediction workflow for incorporating uncertainties arising from inconsistencies between existing seismic velocity models. Our analysis is based on the probabilistic fusion of overlapping seismic velocity models using scalable Gaussian process (GP) regression. Specifically, we fit a GP to two synthetic 1-D velocity profiles simultaneously, and show that the predictive uncertainty accounts for the differences between the models. We subsequently draw velocity model samples from the predictive distribution and estimate peak ground displacement using acoustic wave propagation through the velocity models. The resulting distribution of possible ground motion amplitudes is much wider than would be predicted by simulating shaking using only the two input velocity models. This proof-of-concept illustrates the importance of probabilistic methods for physics-based seismic hazard analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, accepted in the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we formulate decision-making and trajectory planning as a differentiable nonlinear optimization problem, which ensures compatibility with learning-based modules to establish an end-to-end trainable architecture. This optimization introduces explicit objectives related to safety, traveling efficiency, and riding comfort, guiding the learning process in our proposed pipeline. Intrinsic constraints resulting from the decision-making task are integrated into the optimization formulation and preserved throughout the learning process. By integrating the differentiable optimizer with a neural network predictor, the proposed framework is end-to-end trainable, aligning various driving tasks with ultimate performance goals defined by the optimization objectives. The proposed framework is trained and validated using the Waymo Open Motion dataset. The open-loop testing reveals that while the planning outcomes using our method do not always resemble the expert trajectory, they consistently outperform baseline approaches with improved safety, traveling efficiency, and riding comfort. The closed-loop testing further demonstrates the effectiveness of optimizing decisions and improving driving performance. Ablation studies demonstrate that the initialization provided by the learning-based prediction module is essential for the convergence of the optimizer as well as the overall driving performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00420v1)** | 2024-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

| **[Towards Motion Compensation in Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18521v1)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, typically treated with intravitreal injections. Emerging therapies, such as subretinal injections of stem cells, gene therapy, small molecules or RPE cells require precise delivery to avoid damaging delicate retinal structures. Autonomous robotic systems can potentially offer the necessary precision for these procedures. This paper presents a novel approach for motion compensation in robotic subretinal injections, utilizing real-time Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The proposed method leverages B$^{5}$-scans, a rapid acquisition of small-volume OCT data, for dynamic tracking of retinal motion along the Z-axis, compensating for physiological movements such as breathing and heartbeat. Validation experiments on \textit{ex vivo} porcine eyes revealed challenges in maintaining a consistent tool-to-retina distance, with deviations of up to 200 $\mu m$ for 100 $\mu m$ amplitude motions and over 80 $\mu m$ for 25 $\mu m$ amplitude motions over one minute. Subretinal injections faced additional difficulties, with horizontal shifts causing the needle to move off-target and inject into the vitreous. These results highlight the need for improved motion prediction and horizontal stability to enhance the accuracy and safety of robotic subretinal procedures.</p></details> |  |

In MotionWavelet, a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) learns a Wavelet Manifold by applying Wavelet Transformation on the motion data therefore encoding the intricate spatial and temporal motion patterns. Once the Wavelet Manifold is built, WDM trains a diffusion model to generate human motions from Wavelet latent vectors. In addition to the WDM, MotionWavelet also presents a Wavelet Space Shaping Guidance mechanism to refine the denoising process to improve conformity with the manifold structure.

As autonomous driving continues to evolve, the need to assimilate new and varied driving scenarios necessitates frequent model updates through retraining. To address these demands, we introduce DECODE, a novel continual learning framework that begins with a pre-trained generalized model and incrementally develops specialized models for distinct domains. Unlike existing continual learning approaches that attempt to develop a unified model capable of generalizing across diverse scenarios, DECODE uniquely balances specialization with generalization, dynamically adjusting to real-time demands. The proposed framework leverages a hypernetwork to generate model parameters, significantly reducing storage requirements, and incorporates a normalizing flow mechanism for real-time model selection based on likelihood estimation. Furthermore, DECODE merges outputs from the most relevant specialized and generalized models using deep Bayesian uncertainty estimation techniques. This integration ensures optimal performance in familiar conditions while maintaining robustness in unfamiliar scenarios. Extensive evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the framework, achieving a notably low forgetting rate of 0.044 and an average minADE of 0.584 m, significantly surpassing traditional learning strategies and demonstrating adaptability across a wide range of driving conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The efficacy of these devices relies on accurate real-time prediction of the user's intended movements through sensor-based inputs. This paper presents a novel motion prediction framework that integrates three Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and eight surface Electromyography (sEMG) sensors to capture both kinematic and muscular activity data. A comprehensive set of activities, representative of everyday movements in barrier-free environments, was recorded for the purpose. Our findings reveal that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) slightly outperform Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks on a dataset of five motion tasks, achieving classification accuracies of $96.5 \pm 0.8 \%$ and $87.5 \pm 2.9 \%$, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the system's proficiency in transfer learning, enabling accurate motion classification for new subjects using just ten samples per class for finetuning. The robustness of the model is demonstrated by its resilience to sensor failures resulting in absent signals, maintaining reliable performance in real-world scenarios. These results underscore the potential of deep learning algorithms to enhance the functionality and safety of ankle exoskeletons, ultimately improving their usability in daily life.</p></details> |  |
| **[ModeSeq: Taming Sparse Multimodal Motion Prediction with Sequential Mode Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11911v1)** | 2024-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe autonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and misaligned mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or rule-based trajectory selection, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches have overlooked the potential of these environments, focusing instead on static contexts without considering userspecific factors. Employing the CREATTIVE3D dataset, our work models trajectories recorded in virtual reality (VR) scenes for diverse situations including road-crossing tasks with user interactions and simulated visual impairments. We propose Diverse Context VR Human Motion Prediction (DiVR), a cross-modal transformer based on the Perceiver architecture that integrates both static and dynamic scene context using a heterogeneous graph convolution network. We conduct extensive experiments comparing DiVR against existing architectures including MLP, LSTM, and transformers with gaze and point cloud context. Additionally, we also stress test our model's generalizability across different users, tasks, and scenes. Results show that DiVR achieves higher accuracy and adaptability compared to other models and to static graphs. This work highlights the advantages of using VR datasets for context-aware human trajectory modeling, with potential applications in enhancing user experiences in the metaverse.

This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes.

Unlike single person motion prediction, it considers not just the skeleton structures or human trajectories but also the interactions between others. Previous methods use various networks to achieve impressive predictions but often overlook that the joints relations within an individual (intra-relation) and interactions among groups (inter-relation) are distinct types of representations. These methods often lack explicit representation of inter&intra-relations, and inevitably introduce undesired dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a new collaborative framework for multi-person motion prediction that explicitly modeling these relations:a GCN-based network for intra-relations and a novel reasoning network for inter-relations.Moreover, we propose a novel plug-and-play aggregation module called the Interaction Aggregation Module (IAM), which employs an aggregate-attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these relations. Experiments indicate that the module can also be applied to other dual-path models. Extensive experiments on the 3DPW, 3DPW-RC, CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, as well as synthesized datasets Mix1 & Mix2 (9 to 15 persons), demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

In this paper, we address these limitations by integrating multiple datasets, encompassing both trajectory and 3D pose keypoints, to propose a pre-trained model for human motion prediction. We merge seven distinct datasets across varying modalities and standardize their formats. To facilitate multimodal pre-training, we introduce Multi-Transmotion, an innovative transformer-based model designed for cross-modality pre-training. Additionally, we present a novel masking strategy to capture rich representations. Our methodology demonstrates competitive performance across various datasets on several downstream tasks, including trajectory prediction in the NBA and JTA datasets, as well as pose prediction in the AMASS and 3DPW datasets.

In this paper, we proposed an integrative approach that combines motion prediction and trajectory planning to enable safe and socially-aware robot navigation. The main idea of the proposed method is to leverage the advantages of Socially Acceptable trajectory prediction and Timed Elastic Band (TEB) by incorporating human interactive information including position, orientation, and motion into the objective function of the TEB algorithms. In addition, we designed social constraints to ensure the safety of robot navigation. The proposed system is evaluated through physical simulation using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, demonstrating its superior performance in avoiding human and dynamic obstacles, thereby ensuring safe navigation.

| **[Multi-modal Motion Prediction using Temporal Ensembling with Learning-based Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19606v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a shift towards learning-based methods for trajectory prediction, with challenges remaining in addressing uncertainty and capturing multi-modal distributions. This paper introduces Temporal Ensembling with Learning-based Aggregation, a meta-algorithm designed to mitigate the issue of missing behaviors in trajectory prediction, which leads to inconsistent predictions across consecutive frames. Unlike conventional model ensembling, temporal ensembling leverages predictions from nearby frames to enhance spatial coverage and prediction diversity. By confirming predictions from multiple frames, temporal ensembling compensates for occasional errors in individual frame predictions. Furthermore, trajectory-level aggregation, often utilized in model ensembling, is insufficient for temporal ensembling due to a lack of consideration of traffic context and its tendency to assign candidate trajectories with incorrect driving behaviors to final predictions. We further emphasize the necessity of learning-based aggregation by utilizing mode queries within a DETR-like architecture for our temporal ensembling, leveraging the characteristics of predictions from nearby frames. Our method, validated on the Argoverse 2 dataset, shows notable improvements: a 4% reduction in minADE, a 5% decrease in minFDE, and a 1.16% reduction in the miss rate compared to the strongest baseline, QCNet, highlighting its efficacy and potential in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024), accepted by IROS2024</p></details> |

Our method jointly optimizes a scene-level objective connecting motion and environments, and an instance-level objective to refine learned representations. Scene-level representations are learned via non-contrastive similarity learning of past motion sequences and environment context. At the instance level, we use masked autoencoding to refine multimodal polyline representations. We complement this with an adaptive pre-training decoder that enables JointMotion to generalize across different environment representations, fusion mechanisms, and dataset characteristics. Notably, our method reduces the joint final displacement error of Wayformer, HPTR, and Scene Transformer models by 3\%, 8\%, and 12\%, respectively; and enables transfer learning between the Waymo Open Motion and the Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting datasets.

| **[PhysORD: A Neuro-Symbolic Approach for Physics-infused Motion Prediction in Off-road Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01596v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction is critical for autonomous off-road driving, however, it presents significantly more challenges than on-road driving because of the complex interaction between the vehicle and the terrain. Traditional physics-based approaches encounter difficulties in accurately modeling dynamic systems and external disturbance. In contrast, data-driven neural networks require extensive datasets and struggle with explicitly capturing the fundamental physical laws, which can easily lead to poor generalization. By merging the advantages of both methods, neuro-symbolic approaches present a promising direction. These methods embed physical laws into neural models, potentially significantly improving generalization capabilities. However, no prior works were evaluated in real-world settings for off-road driving. To bridge this gap, we present PhysORD, a neural-symbolic approach integrating the conservation law, i.e., the Euler-Lagrange equation, into data-driven neural models for motion prediction in off-road driving. Our experiments showed that PhysORD can accurately predict vehicle motion and tolerate external disturbance by modeling uncertainties. The learned dynamics model achieves 46.7% higher accuracy using only 3.1% of the parameters compared to data-driven methods, demonstrating the data efficiency and superior generalization ability of our neural-symbolic method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Credal Bayesian Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09656v5)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification and robustness to distribution shifts are important goals in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) allow for uncertainty in the predictions to be assessed, different sources of predictive uncertainty cannot be distinguished properly. We present Credal Bayesian Deep Learning (CBDL). Heuristically, CBDL allows to train an (uncountably) infinite ensemble of BNNs, using only finitely many elements. This is possible thanks to prior and likelihood finitely generated credal sets (FGCSs), a concept from the imprecise probability literature. Intuitively, convex combinations of a finite collection of prior-likelihood pairs are able to represent infinitely many such pairs. After training, CBDL outputs a set of posteriors on the parameters of the neural network. At inference time, such posterior set is used to derive a set of predictive distributions that is in turn utilized to distinguish between (predictive) aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and to quantify them. The predictive set also produces either (i) a collection of outputs enjoying desirable probabilistic guarantees, or (ii) the single output that is deemed the best, that is, the one having the highest predictive lower probability -- another imprecise-probabilistic concept. CBDL is more robust than single BNNs to prior and likelihood misspecification, and to distribution shift. We show that CBDL is better at quantifying and disentangling different types of (predictive) uncertainties than single BNNs and ensemble of BNNs. In addition, we apply CBDL to two case studies to demonstrate its downstream tasks capabilities: one, for motion prediction in autonomous driving scenarios, and two, to model blood glucose and insulin dynamics for artificial pancreas control. We show that CBDL performs better when compared to an ensemble of BNNs baseline.</p></details> |  |

The autonomous vehicle can use this information to prevent any possible accidents and create a comfortable and pleasant driving experience for the passengers and pedestrians. A wealth of research was done on the topic from the authors of robotics, computer vision, intelligent transportation systems, and other fields. However, a relatively unexplored angle is the integration of the state-of-art solutions into existing autonomous driving stacks and evaluating them in real-life conditions rather than sanitized datasets. We analyze selected publications with provided open-source solutions and provide a perspective obtained by integrating them into existing Autonomous Driving framework - Autoware Mini and performing experiments in natural urban conditions in Tartu, Estonia to determine valuability of traditional motion prediction metrics. This perspective should be valuable to any potential autonomous driving or robotics engineer looking for the real-world performance of the existing state-of-art pedestrian motion prediction problem.

Existing methods have synthesised body motion only from observed past motion, despite the fact that human eye gaze is known to correlate strongly with body movements and is readily available in recent VR/AR headsets. We present GazeMoDiff - a novel gaze-guided denoising diffusion model to generate stochastic human motions. Our method first uses a gaze encoder and a motion encoder to extract the gaze and motion features respectively, then employs a graph attention network to fuse these features, and finally injects the gaze-motion features into a noise prediction network via a cross-attention mechanism to progressively generate multiple reasonable human motions in the future. Extensive experiments on the MoGaze and GIMO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of multi-modal final displacement error (17.3% on MoGaze and 13.3% on GIMO). We further conducted a human study (N=21) and validated that the motions generated by our method were perceived as both more precise and more realistic than those of prior methods. Taken together, these results reveal the significant information content available in eye gaze for stochastic human motion prediction as well as the effectiveness of our method in exploiting this information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at PG 2024.

Therefore, there has been a growing interest in time series motion prediction research, leading to significant advancements in state-of-the-art techniques in recent years.

| **[Fast Online Learning of CLiFF-maps in Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12237v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maps of dynamics are effective representations of motion patterns learned from prior observations, with recent research demonstrating their ability to enhance performance in various downstream tasks such as human-aware robot navigation, long-term human motion prediction, and robot localization. Current advancements have primarily concentrated on methods for learning maps of human flow in environments where the flow is static, i.e., not assumed to change over time. In this paper we propose a method to update the CLiFF-map, one type of map of dynamics, for achieving efficient life-long robot operation. As new observations are collected, our goal is to update a CLiFF-map to effectively and accurately integrate new observations, while retaining relevant historic motion patterns. The proposed online update method maintains a probabilistic representation in each observed location, updating parameters by continuously tracking sufficient statistics. In experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method is able to maintain accurate representations of human motion dynamics, contributing to high performance flow-compliant planning downstream tasks, while being orders of magnitude faster than the comparable baselines.</p></details> |  |

While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 8.83% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</p></details> | Under Review |

Most of these devices work by translating visual information into voice commands. In complex scenarios where multiple objects are present, it is imperative to prioritize object detection and provide immediate notifications for key entities in specific directions. This brings the need for identifying the observer's motion direction (ego-motion) by merely processing visual information, which is the key contribution of this paper. Specifically, we introduce Motor Focus, a lightweight image-based framework that predicts the ego-motion - the humans (and humanoid machines) movement intentions based on their visual feeds, while filtering out camera motion without any camera calibration. To this end, we implement an optical flow-based pixel-wise temporal analysis method to compensate for the camera motion with a Gaussian aggregation to smooth out the movement prediction area. Subsequently, to evaluate the performance, we collect a dataset including 50 clips of pedestrian scenes in 5 different scenarios. We tested this framework with classical feature detectors such as SIFT and ORB to show the comparison. Our framework demonstrates its superiority in speed (> 40FPS), accuracy (MAE = 60pixels), and robustness (SNR = 23dB), confirming its potential to enhance the usability of vision-based assistive navigation tools in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

Our study of marine vessel (in our case Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)) dynamics influenced by strong wave motion has resulted in a novel nonlinear mathematical USV model with 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is required for precise USV state estimation and motion prediction. The proposed state estimation approach fuses data from multiple sensors onboard the UAV and the USV to enable redundancy and robustness under varying weather conditions of real-world applications. The proposed approach provides estimated states of the USV with 6 DOFs and predicts its future states to enable tight control of both vehicles on a receding control horizon. The proposed approach was extensively tested in the realistic Gazebo simulator and successfully experimentally validated in many real-world experiments representing different application scenarios, including agile landing on an oscillating and moving USV. A comparative study indicates that the proposed approach significantly surpassed the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Unlike unconditional or text-conditioned dynamics generation, action-conditioned dynamics requires perceiving the physical material properties of objects and grounding the 3D motion prediction on these properties, such as object stiffness. However, estimating physical material properties is an open problem due to the lack of material ground-truth data, as measuring these properties for real objects is highly difficult. We present PhysDreamer, a physics-based approach that endows static 3D objects with interactive dynamics by leveraging the object dynamics priors learned by video generation models. By distilling these priors, PhysDreamer enables the synthesis of realistic object responses to novel interactions, such as external forces or agent manipulations. We demonstrate our approach on diverse examples of elastic objects and evaluate the realism of the synthesized interactions through a user study.

Existing methods for motion forecasting or motion generation rely solely on either prior motions or text prompts, facing limitations with precision or control, particularly over extended durations. The multi-modal nature of our approach enhances the contextual understanding of human motion, while our graph-based transformer framework effectively capture both spatial and temporal motion dynamics. As a result, our model consistently outperforms existing generative techniques in accurately predicting long-term motions. Additionally, by leveraging diffusion models' ability to capture different modes of prediction, we estimate uncertainty, significantly improving spatial awareness in human-robot interactions by incorporating zones of presence with varying confidence levels for each body joint.</p></details> |  |

Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X bandwidth limitations and transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 16.4\% with fewer missing detections compared with the no cooperation setting and by 12.3\% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios.

Current methods typically rely on ground truth human poses as observed input, which is not practical for real-world scenarios where only raw visual sensor data is available. To implement these methods in practice, a pre-phrase of pose estimation is essential. However, such two-stage approaches often lead to performance degradation due to the accumulation of errors. Moreover, reducing raw visual data to sparse keypoint representations significantly diminishes the density of information, resulting in the loss of fine-grained features. In this paper, we propose \textit{LiDAR-HMP}, the first single-LiDAR-based 3D human motion prediction approach, which receives the raw LiDAR point cloud as input and forecasts future 3D human poses directly. Building upon our novel structure-aware body feature descriptor, LiDAR-HMP adaptively maps the observed motion manifold to future poses and effectively models the spatial-temporal correlations of human motions for further refinement of prediction results. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable robustness and efficacy in real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM Oral 2024</p></details> |

Characterizing these interactions is crucial both from the immediate robot autonomy perspective (for motion prediction and control) as well as a long-term predictive maintenance and diagnostics perspective. An ideal solution entails capturing precise state measurements for decisions and controls, which is considerably difficult, especially in increasingly unstructured outdoor regimes of operations for these robots. In this milieu, a framework to identify pre-determined discrete modes of operation can considerably simplify the motion model identification process. To this end, we propose an interactive multiple model (IMM) based filtering framework to probabilistically identify predefined robot operation modes that could arise due to traversal in different terrains or loss of wheel traction.</p></details> |  |

Traditional parameter estimation methods face limitations such as reliance on initial guesses, labor-intensive fitting procedures, and complex testing setups. On the other hand, purely data-driven machine learning methods struggle to capture inherent physical constraints and typically require large datasets for optimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Fine-Tuning Hybrid Dynamics (FTHD) method, which integrates supervised and unsupervised Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), combining physics-based modeling with data-driven techniques. FTHD fine-tunes a pre-trained Deep Dynamics Model (DDM) using a smaller training dataset, delivering superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods such as the Deep Pacejka Model (DPM) and outperforming the original DDM. Furthermore, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is embedded within FTHD (EKF-FTHD) to effectively manage noisy real-world data, ensuring accurate denoising while preserving the vehicle's essential physical characteristics. The proposed FTHD framework is validated through scaled simulations using the BayesRace Physics-based Simulator and full-scale real-world experiments from the Indy Autonomous Challenge. Results demonstrate that the hybrid approach significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy, even with reduced data, and outperforms existing models. EKF-FTHD enhances robustness by denoising real-world data while maintaining physical insights, representing a notable advancement in vehicle dynamics modeling for high-speed autonomous racing.</p></details> |  |

To date, only one study has examined the vulnerability of human motion prediction to evasion attacks. In this paper, we propose BadHMP, the first backdoor attack that targets specifically human motion prediction. Our approach involves generating poisoned training samples by embedding a localized backdoor trigger in one arm of the skeleton, causing selected joints to remain relatively still or follow predefined motion in historical time steps. Subsequently, the future sequences are globally modified to the target sequences, and the entire training dataset is traversed to select the most suitable samples for poisoning. Our carefully designed backdoor triggers and targets guarantee the smoothness and naturalness of the poisoned samples, making them stealthy enough to evade detection by the model trainer while keeping the poisoned model unobtrusive in terms of prediction fidelity to untainted sequences. The target sequences can be successfully activated by the designed input sequences even with a low poisoned sample injection ratio. Experimental results on two datasets (Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap) and two network architectures (LTD and HRI) demonstrate the high-fidelity, effectiveness, and stealthiness of BadHMP. Robustness of our attack against fine-tuning defense is also verified.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the static to openable (S2O) task which creates interactive articulated 3D objects from static counterparts through openable part detection, motion prediction, and interior geometry completion. We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CASPFormer: Trajectory Prediction from BEV Images with Deformable Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17790v1)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction is an important aspect for Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |
| **[Data-efficient Trajectory Prediction via Coreset Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern vehicles are equipped with multiple information-collection devices such as sensors and cameras, continuously generating a large volume of raw data. Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes using Mamba, a state-of-the-art architecture with potential applications in LLMs, for robotic imitation learning, highlighting its ability to function as an encoder that effectively captures contextual information. By reducing the dimensionality of the state space, Mamba operates similarly to an autoencoder. It effectively compresses the sequential information into state variables while preserving the essential temporal dynamics necessary for accurate motion prediction. Experimental results in tasks such as cup placing and case loading demonstrate that despite exhibiting higher estimation errors, Mamba achieves superior success rates compared to Transformers in practical task execution. This performance is attributed to Mamba's structure, which encompasses the state space model. Additionally, the study investigates Mamba's capacity to serve as a real-time motion generator with a limited amount of training data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

The diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting high-quality motion samples with reasonable diversity, but suffers from a slow generative process which necessitates multiple model evaluations, hindering real-world applications. To enable real-time prediction, in this work, we propose training a one-step multi-layer perceptron-based (MLP-based) diffusion model for motion prediction using knowledge distillation and Bayesian optimization. Our method contains two steps. First, we distill a pretrained diffusion-based motion predictor, TransFusion, directly into a one-step diffusion model with the same denoiser architecture. Then, to further reduce the inference time, we remove the computationally expensive components from the original denoiser and use knowledge distillation once again to distill the obtained one-step diffusion model into an even smaller model based solely on MLPs. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the hyperparameters for training the smaller diffusion model. Extensive experimental studies are conducted on benchmark datasets, and our model can significantly improve the inference speed, achieving real-time prediction without noticeable degradation in performance.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight stems from the observation that complete and reliable historical trajectory data plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate motion prediction. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm that prioritizes the reconstruction of intact historical trajectories before feeding them into the prediction modules. Our approach introduces a novel scene tokenization module to enhance the extraction and fusion of spatial and temporal features. Following this, our proposed recovery module reconstructs agents' incomplete historical trajectories by leveraging local map topology and interactions with nearby agents. The reconstructed, clean historical data is then integrated into the downstream prediction modules. Our framework is able to effectively handle missing data of varying lengths and remains robust against observation noise, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our recovery module is compatible with existing prediction models, ensuring seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, and deployment in real-world autonomous vehicles confirms its practical utility. In the 2024 Waymo Motion Prediction Competition, our method, RMP-YOLO, achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing third place.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph-based Motion Generation with Multi-modal Interaction Relational Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11676v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intricate nature of real-world driving environments, characterized by dynamic and diverse interactions among multiple vehicles and their possible future states, presents considerable challenges in accurately predicting the motion states of vehicles and handling the uncertainty inherent in the predictions. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive modeling and reasoning to capture the implicit relations among vehicles and the corresponding diverse behaviors. This research introduces an integrated framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) motion prediction to address these complexities, utilizing a novel Relational Hypergraph Interaction-informed Neural mOtion generator (RHINO). RHINO leverages hypergraph-based relational reasoning by integrating a multi-scale hypergraph neural network to model group-wise interactions among multiple vehicles and their multi-modal driving behaviors, thereby enhancing motion prediction accuracy and reliability. Experimental validation using real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of this framework in improving predictive accuracy and fostering socially aware automated driving in dynamic traffic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Long-Term Multi-Scenario Prediction for Maneuver Planning at Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14879v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction for intelligent vehicles typically focuses on estimating the most probable future evolutions of a traffic scenario. Estimating the gap acceptance, i.e., whether a vehicle merges or crosses before another vehicle with the right of way, is often handled implicitly in the prediction. However, an infrastructure-based maneuver planning can assign artificial priorities between cooperative vehicles, so it needs to evaluate many more potential scenarios. Additionally, the prediction horizon has to be long enough to assess the impact of a maneuver. We, therefore, present a novel long-term prediction approach handling the gap acceptance estimation and the velocity prediction in two separate stages. Thereby, the behavior of regular vehicles as well as priority assignments of cooperative vehicles can be considered. We train both stages on real-world traffic observations to achieve realistic prediction results. Our method has a competitive accuracy and is fast enough to predict a multitude of scenarios in a short time, making it suitable to be used in a maneuver planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The advantage of our approach is that it derives the robot action explicitly from object motion prediction, yielding a more robust policy by understanding the object motions. Also, beyond policies trained on embodiment-centric data, our method is embodiment-agnostic, generalizable across diverse embodiments, and being able to learn from human demonstrations. Our method comprises three components: an object-part predictor to locate the part for the end effector to manipulate, an RGBD video generator to predict future RGBD videos, and a trajectory planner to extract embodiment-agnostic transformation sequences and solve the trajectory for diverse embodiments. Trained on videos even without trajectory data, our method still outperforms existing works significantly by 27.7% and 26.2% on the prevailing virtual environments MetaWorld and Franka-Kitchen, respectively. Furthermore, we conducted real-world experiments, showing that our policy, trained only with human demonstration, can be deployed to various embodiments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

However, the need for extensive manual intervention to stabilize mesh sequences and the generation of excessively large assets in existing workflows impedes broader adoption. In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian-based approach, dubbed \textit{DualGS}, for real-time and high-fidelity playback of complex human performance with excellent compression ratios. Our key idea in DualGS is to separately represent motion and appearance using the corresponding skin and joint Gaussians. Such an explicit disentanglement can significantly reduce motion redundancy and enhance temporal coherence. We begin by initializing the DualGS and anchoring skin Gaussians to joint Gaussians at the first frame. Subsequently, we employ a coarse-to-fine training strategy for frame-by-frame human performance modeling. It includes a coarse alignment phase for overall motion prediction as well as a fine-grained optimization for robust tracking and high-fidelity rendering. To integrate volumetric video seamlessly into VR environments, we efficiently compress motion using entropy encoding and appearance using codec compression coupled with a persistent codebook. Our approach achieves a compression ratio of up to 120 times, only requiring approximately 350KB of storage per frame. We demonstrate the efficacy of our representation through photo-realistic, free-view experiences on VR headsets, enabling users to immersively watch musicians in performance and feel the rhythm of the notes at the performers' fingertips.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

To help address this challenge, we present PRO-MIND, a novel human-in-the-loop framework that leverages valuable data about the human co-worker to optimise robot trajectories. By estimating human attention and mental effort, our method dynamically adjusts safety zones and enables on-the-fly alterations of the robot path to enhance human comfort and optimal stopping conditions. Moreover, we formulate a multi-objective optimisation to adapt the robot's trajectory execution time and smoothness based on the current human psycho-physical stress, estimated from heart rate variability and frantic movements. These adaptations exploit the properties of B-spline curves to preserve continuity and smoothness, which are crucial factors in improving motion predictability and comfort. Evaluation in two realistic case studies showcases the framework's ability to restrain the operators' workload and stress and to ensure their safety while enhancing human-robot productivity. Further strengths of PRO-MIND include its adaptability to each individual's specific needs and sensitivity to variations in attention, mental effort, and stress during task execution.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Adaptive Visual Servoing for On-Orbit Servicing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05295v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an adaptive visual servoing framework for robotic on-orbit servicing (OOS), specifically designed for capturing tumbling satellites. The vision-guided robotic system is capable of selecting optimal control actions in the event of partial or complete vision system failure, particularly in the short term. The autonomous system accounts for physical and operational constraints, executing visual servoing tasks to minimize a cost function. A hierarchical control architecture is developed, integrating a variant of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm for image registration, a constrained noise-adaptive Kalman filter, fault detection and recovery logic, and a constrained optimal path planner. The dynamic estimator provides real-time estimates of unknown states and uncertain parameters essential for motion prediction, while ensuring consistency through a set of inequality constraints. It also adjusts the Kalman filter parameters adaptively in response to unexpected vision errors. In the event of vision system faults, a recovery strategy is activated, guided by fault detection logic that monitors the visual feedback via the metric fit error of image registration. The estimated/predicted pose and parameters are subsequently fed into an optimal path planner, which directs the robot's end-effector to the target's grasping point. This process is subject to multiple constraints, including acceleration limits, smooth capture, and line-of-sight maintenance with the target. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed visual servoing system successfully captured a free-floating object, despite complete occlusion of the vision system.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.02156</p></details> |

We study this in the setting of two dancers dancing as a couple. We first consider a baseline in which we predict a dancer's future moves conditioned only on their past motion without regard to their partner. We then investigate the advantage of taking social information into account by conditioning also on the motion of their dancing partner. We focus our analysis on Swing, a dance genre with tight physical coupling for which we present an in-the-wild video dataset. We demonstrate that single-person future motion prediction in this context is challenging. Instead, we observe that prediction greatly benefits from considering the interaction partners' behavior, resulting in surprisingly compelling couple dance synthesis results (see supp. video). Our contributions are a demonstration of the advantages of socially conditioned future motion prediction and an in-the-wild, couple dance video dataset to enable future research in this direction.

| **[Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer for Incomplete Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00904v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Visibility-Aware Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06363v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target tracking has numerous significant civilian and military applications, and maintaining the visibility of the target plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the tracking task. Existing visibility-aware planners primarily focus on keeping the target within the limited field of view of an onboard sensor and avoiding obstacle occlusion. However, the negative impact of system uncertainty is often neglected, rendering the planners delicate to uncertainties in practice. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a real-time, non-myopic trajectory planner for visibility-aware and safe target tracking in the presence of system uncertainty. For more accurate target motion prediction, we introduce the concept of belief-space probability of detection (BPOD) to measure the predictive visibility of the target under stochastic robot and target states. An Extended Kalman Filter variant incorporating BPOD is developed to predict target belief state under uncertain visibility within the planning horizon. To reach real-time trajectory planning, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to uniformly calculate both BPOD and the chance-constrained collision risk by utilizing linearized signed distance function (SDF), and then design a two-stage strategy for lightweight calculation of SDF in sequential convex programming. Extensive simulation results with benchmark comparisons show the capacity of the proposed approach to robustly maintain the visibility of the target under high system uncertainty. The practicality of the proposed trajectory planner is validated by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report for our conference paper in 2024 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Most prior works learn motion distributions through encoding-decoding in the latent space, which does not preserve motion's spatial-temporal structure. While effective, these methods often require complex, multi-stage training and yield predictions that are inconsistent with the provided history and can be physically unrealistic. To address these issues, we propose CoMusion, a single-stage, end-to-end diffusion-based stochastic HMP framework. CoMusion is inspired from the insight that a smooth future pose initialization improves prediction performance, a strategy not previously utilized in stochastic models but evidenced in deterministic works. To generate such initialization, CoMusion's motion predictor starts with a Transformer-based network for initial reconstruction of corrupted motion. Then, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to refine the prediction considering past observations in the discrete cosine transformation (DCT) space. Our method, facilitated by the Transformer-GCN module design and a proposed variance scheduler, excels in predicting accurate, realistic, and consistent motions, while maintaining appropriate diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoMusion surpasses prior methods across metrics, while demonstrating superior generation quality. Our Code is released at https://github.com/jsun57/CoMusion/ .</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[MambaTrack: A Simple Baseline for Multiple Object Tracking with State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09178v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking by detection has been the prevailing paradigm in the field of Multi-object Tracking (MOT). These methods typically rely on the Kalman Filter to estimate the future locations of objects, assuming linear object motion. However, they fall short when tracking objects exhibiting nonlinear and diverse motion in scenarios like dancing and sports. In addition, there has been limited focus on utilizing learning-based motion predictors in MOT. To address these challenges, we resort to exploring data-driven motion prediction methods. Inspired by the great expectation of state space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, in long-term sequence modeling with near-linear complexity, we introduce a Mamba-based motion model named Mamba moTion Predictor (MTP). MTP is designed to model the complex motion patterns of objects like dancers and athletes. Specifically, MTP takes the spatial-temporal location dynamics of objects as input, captures the motion pattern using a bi-Mamba encoding layer, and predicts the next motion. In real-world scenarios, objects may be missed due to occlusion or motion blur, leading to premature termination of their trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we further expand the application of MTP. We employ it in an autoregressive way to compensate for missing observations by utilizing its own predictions as inputs, thereby contributing to more consistent trajectories. Our proposed tracker, MambaTrack, demonstrates advanced performance on benchmarks such as Dancetrack and SportsMOT, which are characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> |
| **[DivDiff: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Diverse Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00014v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse human motion prediction (HMP) aims to predict multiple plausible future motions given an observed human motion sequence. It is a challenging task due to the diversity of potential human motions while ensuring an accurate description of future human motions. Current solutions are either low-diversity or limited in expressiveness. Recent denoising diffusion models (DDPM) hold potential generative capabilities in generative tasks. However, introducing DDPM directly into diverse HMP incurs some issues. Although DDPM can increase the diversity of the potential patterns of human motions, the predicted human motions become implausible over time because of the significant noise disturbances in the forward process of DDPM. This phenomenon leads to the predicted human motions being hard to control, seriously impacting the quality of predicted motions and restricting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this, we propose a novel conditional diffusion-based generative model, called DivDiff, to predict more diverse and realistic human motions. Specifically, the DivDiff employs DDPM as our backbone and incorporates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and transformer mechanisms to encode the observed human motion sequence as a condition to instruct the reverse process of DDPM. More importantly, we design a diversified reinforcement sampling function (DRSF) to enforce human skeletal constraints on the predicted human motions. DRSF utilizes the acquired information from human skeletal as prior knowledge, thereby reducing significant disturbances introduced during the forward process. Extensive results received in the experiments on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

In previous studies, researchers propose enhancing pedestrian trajectory predictions by using manually crafted labels to categorize pedestrian behaviors and intentions. However, these approaches often only capture a limited range of pedestrian behaviors and introduce human bias into the predictions. To alleviate the dependency on manually crafted labels, we utilize a transformer encoder coupled with hierarchical density-based clustering to automatically identify diverse behavior patterns, and use these clusters in data-driven reachability analysis. By using a transformer-based approach, we seek to enhance the representation of pedestrian trajectories and uncover characteristics or features that are subsequently used to group trajectories into different "behavior" clusters. We show that these behavior clusters can be used with data-driven reachability analysis, yielding an end-to-end data-driven approach to predicting the future motion of pedestrians. We train and evaluate our approach on a real pedestrian dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in forecasting pedestrian movements.</p></details> |  |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Past Movements-Guided Motion Representation Learning for Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02091v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction based on 3D skeleton is a significant challenge in computer vision, primarily focusing on the effective representation of motion. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework designed to enhance motion representation. This framework consists of two stages: first, the network is pretrained through the self-reconstruction of past sequences, and the guided reconstruction of future sequences based on past movements. We design a velocity-based mask strategy to focus on the joints with large-scale moving. Subsequently, the pretrained network undergoes finetuning for specific tasks. Self-reconstruction, guided by patterns of past motion, substantially improves the model's ability to represent the spatiotemporal relationships among joints but also captures the latent relationships between past and future sequences. This capability is crucial for motion prediction tasks that solely depend on historical motion data. By employing this straightforward yet effective training paradigm, our method outperforms existing \textit{state-of-the-art} methods, reducing the average prediction errors by 8.8\% across Human3.6M, 3DPW, and AMASS datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/JunyuShi02/PMG-MRL.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Forecasting Future Videos from Novel Views via Disentangled 3D Scene Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21450v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video extrapolation in space and time (VEST) enables viewers to forecast a 3D scene into the future and view it from novel viewpoints. Recent methods propose to learn an entangled representation, aiming to model layered scene geometry, motion forecasting and novel view synthesis together, while assuming simplified affine motion and homography-based warping at each scene layer, leading to inaccurate video extrapolation. Instead of entangled scene representation and rendering, our approach chooses to disentangle scene geometry from scene motion, via lifting the 2D scene to 3D point clouds, which enables high quality rendering of future videos from novel views. To model future 3D scene motion, we propose a disentangled two-stage approach that initially forecasts ego-motion and subsequently the residual motion of dynamic objects (e.g., cars, people). This approach ensures more precise motion predictions by reducing inaccuracies from entanglement of ego-motion with dynamic object motion, where better ego-motion forecasting could significantly enhance the visual outcomes. Extensive experimental analysis on two urban scene datasets demonstrate superior performance of our proposed method in comparison to strong baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Intention-Aware Planner for Robust and Safe Aerial Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08854v4)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous target tracking with quadrotors has wide applications in many scenarios, such as cinematographic follow-up shooting or suspect chasing. Target motion prediction is necessary when designing the tracking planner. However, the widely used constant velocity or constant rotation assumption can not fully capture the dynamics of the target. The tracker may fail when the target happens to move aggressively, such as sudden turn or deceleration. In this paper, we propose an intention-aware planner by additionally considering the intention of the target to enhance safety and robustness in aerial tracking applications. Firstly, a designated intention prediction method is proposed, which combines a user-defined potential assessment function and a state observation function. A reachable region is generated to specifically evaluate the turning intentions. Then we design an intention-driven hybrid A* method to predict the future possible positions for the target. Finally, an intention-aware optimization approach is designed to generate a spatial-temporal optimal trajectory, allowing the tracker to perceive unexpected situations from the target. Benchmark comparisons and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, accepted by 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
