| **[A Scalable Framework for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03582v3)** | 2019-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction (TP) is of great importance for a wide range of location-based applications in intelligent transport systems such as location-based advertising, route planning, traffic management, and early warning systems. In the last few years, the widespread use of GPS navigation systems and wireless communication technology enabled vehicles has resulted in huge volumes of trajectory data. The task of utilizing this data employing spatio-temporal techniques for trajectory prediction in an efficient and accurate manner is an ongoing research problem. Existing TP approaches are limited to short-term predictions. Moreover, they cannot handle a large volume of trajectory data for long-term prediction. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable clustering and Markov chain based hybrid framework, called Traj-clusiVAT-based TP, for both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction, which can handle a large number of overlapping trajectories in a dense road network. Traj-clusiVAT can also determine the number of clusters, which represent different movement behaviours in input trajectory data. In our experiments, we compare our proposed approach with a mixed Markov model (MMM)-based scheme, and a trajectory clustering, NETSCAN-based TP method for both short- and long-term trajectory predictions. We performed our experiments on two real, vehicle trajectory datasets, including a large-scale trajectory dataset consisting of 3.28 million trajectories obtained from 15,061 taxis in Singapore over a period of one month. Experimental results on two real trajectory datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both short- and long-term prediction performances, based on prediction accuracy and distance error (in km).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System.

| **[Trajectory-Prediction with Vision: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13354v1)** | 2023-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To plan a safe and efficient route, an autonomous vehicle should anticipate future trajectories of other agents around it. Trajectory prediction is an extremely challenging task which recently gained a lot of attention in the autonomous vehicle research community. Trajectory-prediction forecasts future state of all the dynamic agents in the scene given their current and past states. A good prediction model can prevent collisions on the road, and hence the ultimate goal for autonomous vehicles: Collision rate: collisions per Million miles. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the field trajectory-prediction. We categorize the relevant algorithms into different classes so that researchers can follow through the trends in the trajectory-prediction research field. Moreover we also touch upon the background knowledge required to formulate a trajectory-prediction problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13778v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting human trajectories is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, yet current data-driven models often lack robustness in case of noisy inputs such as adversarial examples or imperfect observations. Although some trajectory prediction methods have been developed to provide empirical robustness, these methods are heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for trajectory prediction that provides guaranteed robustness. To this end, we address the unique challenges associated with trajectory prediction, such as unbounded outputs and multi-modality. To mitigate the inherent performance drop through certification, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory denoiser and integrate it into our method. Moreover, we introduce new certified performance metrics to reliably measure the trajectory prediction performance. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the certified predictors and highlight their advantages over the non-certified ones. The code is available online: https://s-attack.github.io/.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Trajectory Prediction with Linguistic Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09741v2)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language allows humans to build mental models that interpret what is happening around them resulting in more accurate long-term predictions. We present a novel trajectory prediction model that uses linguistic intermediate representations to forecast trajectories, and is trained using trajectory samples with partially-annotated captions. The model learns the meaning of each of the words without direct per-word supervision. At inference time, it generates a linguistic description of trajectories which captures maneuvers and interactions over an extended time interval. This generated description is used to refine predictions of the trajectories of multiple agents. We train and validate our model on the Argoverse dataset, and demonstrate improved accuracy results in trajectory prediction. In addition, our model is more interpretable: it presents part of its reasoning in plain language as captions, which can aid model development and can aid in building confidence in the model before deploying it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICRA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Manipulating Trajectory Prediction with Backdoors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13863v2)** | 2024-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles ought to predict the surrounding agents' trajectories to allow safe maneuvers in uncertain and complex traffic situations. As companies increasingly apply trajectory prediction in the real world, security becomes a relevant concern. In this paper, we focus on backdoors - a security threat acknowledged in other fields but so far overlooked for trajectory prediction. To this end, we describe and investigate four triggers that could affect trajectory prediction. We then show that these triggers (for example, a braking vehicle), when correlated with a desired output (for example, a curve) during training, cause the desired output of a state-of-the-art trajectory prediction model. In other words, the model has good benign performance but is vulnerable to backdoors. This is the case even if the trigger maneuver is performed by a non-casual agent behind the target vehicle. As a side-effect, our analysis reveals interesting limitations within trajectory prediction models. Finally, we evaluate a range of defenses against backdoors. While some, like simple offroad checks, do not enable detection for all triggers, clustering is a promising candidate to support manual inspection to find backdoors.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Online Learning for Ground Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3998v1)** | 2012-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a model based on an hybrid system to numerically simulate the climbing phase of an aircraft. This model is then used within a trajectory prediction tool. Finally, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimization algorithm is used to tune five selected parameters, and thus improve the accuracy of the model. Incorporated within a trajectory prediction tool, this model can be used to derive the order of magnitude of the prediction error over time, and thus the domain of validity of the trajectory prediction. A first validation experiment of the proposed model is based on the errors along time for a one-time trajectory prediction at the take off of the flight with respect to the default values of the theoretical BADA model. This experiment, assuming complete information, also shows the limit of the model. A second experiment part presents an on-line trajectory prediction, in which the prediction is continuously updated based on the current aircraft position. This approach raises several issues, for which improvements of the basic model are proposed, and the resulting trajectory prediction tool shows statistically significantly more accurate results than those of the default model.</p></details> | <details><summary>SESAR...</summary><p>SESAR 2nd Innovation Days (2012)</p></details> |
| **[TNT: Target-driveN Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08294v2)** | 2020-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future behavior of moving agents is essential for real world applications. It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the corresponding behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight is that for prediction within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be effectively captured by a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven trajectory prediction (TNT) framework. TNT has three stages which are trained end-to-end. It first predicts an agent's potential target states $T$ steps into the future, by encoding its interactions with the environment and the other agents. TNT then generates trajectory state sequences conditioned on targets. A final stage estimates trajectory likelihoods and a final compact set of trajectory predictions is selected. This is in contrast to previous work which models agent intents as latent variables, and relies on test-time sampling to generate diverse trajectories. We benchmark TNT on trajectory prediction of vehicles and pedestrians, where we outperform state-of-the-art on Argoverse Forecasting, INTERACTION, Stanford Drone and an in-house Pedestrian-at-Intersection dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Prediction under Unstructured Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14203v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction facilitates effective planning and decision-making, while constrained trajectory prediction integrates regulation into prediction. Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Predictability of the imitative learning trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04862v3)** | 2018-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fitness landscape metaphor plays a central role on the modeling of optimizing principles in many research fields, ranging from evolutionary biology, where it was first introduced, to management research. Here we consider the ensemble of trajectories of the imitative learning search, in which agents exchange information on their fitness and imitate the fittest agent in the population aiming at reaching the global maximum of the fitness landscape. We assess the degree to which the starting and ending points determine the learning trajectories using two measures, namely, the predictability that yields the probability that two randomly chosen trajectories are the same, and the mean path divergence that gauges the dissimilarity between two learning trajectories. We find that the predictability is greater in rugged landscapes than in smooth ones. The mean path divergence, however, is strongly affected by the search parameters -- population size and imitation propensity -- that obliterate the influence of the underlying landscape. The learning trajectories become more deterministic, in the sense that there are fewer distinct trajectories and those trajectories are more similar to each other, with increasing population size and imitation propensity. In addition, we find that the roughness of the learning trajectories, which measures the deviation from additivity of the fitness function, is always greater than the roughness estimated over the entire fitness landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Human Trajectory Prediction with Metamorphic Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18756v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of human trajectories is important for planning in autonomous systems that act in the real world, e.g. automated driving or mobile robots. Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Trajectory Prediction through Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09466v1)** | 2023-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an important task that involves modeling the indeterminate nature of traffic actors to forecast future trajectories given the observed trajectory sequences. However, current methods confine themselves to presumed data manifolds, assuming that trajectories strictly adhere to these manifolds, resulting in overly simplified predictions. To this end, we propose a novel approach called SSWNP (Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction). In our approach, we first create clean and noise-augmented views of past observed trajectories across the spatial domain of waypoints. We then compel the trajectory prediction model to maintain spatial consistency between predictions from these two views, in addition to the trajectory prediction task. Introducing the noise-augmented view mitigates the model's reliance on a narrow interpretation of the data manifold, enabling it to learn more plausible and diverse representations. We also predict the noise present in the two views of past observed trajectories as an auxiliary self-supervised task, enhancing the model's understanding of the underlying representation and future predictions. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the incorporation of SSWNP into the model learning process significantly improves performance, even in noisy environments, when compared to baseline methods. Our approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: NBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++, with experimental results highlighting the substantial improvement achieved in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Cross-domain Trajectory Prediction with CTP-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11645v2)** | 2022-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most pedestrian trajectory prediction methods rely on a huge amount of trajectories annotation, which is time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, a well-trained model may not effectively generalize to a new scenario captured by another camera. Therefore, it is desirable to adapt the model trained on an annotated source domain to the target domain. To achieve domain adaptation for trajectory prediction, we propose a Cross-domain Trajectory Prediction Network (CTP-Net). In this framework, encoders are used in both domains to encode the observed trajectories, then their features are aligned by a cross-domain feature discriminator. Further, considering the consistency between the observed and the predicted trajectories, a target domain offset discriminator is utilized to adversarially regularize the future trajectory predictions to be in line with the observed trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on domain adaptation for pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work is accepted by CICAI(CAAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence), 12 pages</p></details> |
| **[On Adversarial Robustness of Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05057v3)** | 2022-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical component for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perform safe planning and navigation. However, few studies have analyzed the adversarial robustness of trajectory prediction or investigated whether the worst-case prediction can still lead to safe planning. To bridge this gap, we study the adversarial robustness of trajectory prediction models by proposing a new adversarial attack that perturbs normal vehicle trajectories to maximize the prediction error. Our experiments on three models and three datasets show that the adversarial prediction increases the prediction error by more than 150%. Our case studies show that if an adversary drives a vehicle close to the target AV following the adversarial trajectory, the AV may make an inaccurate prediction and even make unsafe driving decisions. We also explore possible mitigation techniques via data augmentation and trajectory smoothing. The implementation is open source at https://github.com/zqzqz/AdvTrajectoryPrediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, accepted by CVPR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Topological Trajectory Prediction with Homotopy Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09821v1)** | 2023-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction in a cluttered environment is key to many important robotics tasks such as autonomous navigation. However, there are an infinite number of possible trajectories to consider. To simplify the space of trajectories under consideration, we utilise homotopy classes to partition the space into countably many mathematically equivalent classes. All members within a class demonstrate identical high-level motion with respect to the environment, i.e., travelling above or below an obstacle. This allows high-level prediction of a trajectory in terms of a sparse label identifying its homotopy class. We therefore present a light-weight learning framework based on variable-order Markov processes to learn and predict homotopy classes and thus high-level agent motion. By informing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with our homotopy class predictions, we see great improvements in low-level trajectory prediction compared to a naive GMM on a real dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, accepted to ICRA 2023</p></details> |
| **[It Is Not the Journey but the Destination: Endpoint Conditioned Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02025v3)** | 2020-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory forecasting with multiple socially interacting agents is of critical importance for autonomous navigation in human environments, e.g., for self-driving cars and social robots. In this work, we present Predicted Endpoint Conditioned Network (PECNet) for flexible human trajectory prediction. PECNet infers distant trajectory endpoints to assist in long-range multi-modal trajectory prediction. A novel non-local social pooling layer enables PECNet to infer diverse yet socially compliant trajectories. Additionally, we present a simple "truncation-trick" for improving few-shot multi-modal trajectory prediction performance. We show that PECNet improves state-of-the-art performance on the Stanford Drone trajectory prediction benchmark by ~20.9% and on the ETH/UCY benchmark by ~40.8%.

| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Action-based Contrastive Learning for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08664v1)** | 2022-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential task for successful human robot interaction, such as in autonomous driving. In this work, we address the problem of predicting future pedestrian trajectories in a first person view setting with a moving camera. To that end, we propose a novel action-based contrastive learning loss, that utilizes pedestrian action information to improve the learned trajectory embeddings. The fundamental idea behind this new loss is that trajectories of pedestrians performing the same action should be closer to each other in the feature space than the trajectories of pedestrians with significantly different actions. In other words, we argue that behavioral information about pedestrian action influences their future trajectory. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling strategy for trajectories that is able to effectively increase negative and positive contrastive samples. Additional synthetic trajectory samples are generated using a trained Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which is at the core of several models developed for trajectory prediction. Results show that our proposed contrastive framework employs contextual information about pedestrian behavior, i.e. action, effectively, and it learns a better trajectory representation. Thus, integrating the proposed contrastive framework within a trajectory prediction model improves its results and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three trajectory prediction benchmarks [31, 32, 26].</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in the proceedings of The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2022)</p></details> |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obstacle-Transformer: A Trajectory Prediction Network Based on Surrounding Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07711v1)** | 2023-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory, and Transformer have made great progress in predicting the trajectories of moving objects. Although the trajectory element with the surrounding scene features has been merged to improve performance, there still exist some problems to be solved. One is that the time series processing models will increase the inference time with the increase of the number of prediction sequences. Another lies in which the features can not be extracted from the scene's image and point cloud in some situations. Therefore, this paper proposes an Obstacle-Transformer to predict trajectory in a constant inference time. An ``obstacle'' is designed by the surrounding trajectory rather than images or point clouds, making Obstacle-Transformer more applicable in a wider range of scenarios. Experiments are conducted on ETH and UCY data sets to verify the performance of our model.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Probability Trajectory: One New Movement Description for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10595v2)** | 2021-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental and challenging task for numerous applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent robots. Currently, most of existing work treat the pedestrian trajectory as a series of fixed two-dimensional coordinates. However, in real scenarios, the trajectory often exhibits randomness, and has its own probability distribution. Inspired by this observed fact, also considering other movement characteristics of pedestrians, we propose one simple and intuitive movement description, probability trajectory, which maps the coordinate points of pedestrian trajectory into two-dimensional Gaussian distribution in images. Based on this unique description, we develop one novel trajectory prediction method, called social probability. The method combines the new probability trajectory and powerful convolution recurrent neural networks together. Both the input and output of our method are probability trajectories, which provide the recurrent neural network with sufficient spatial and random information of moving pedestrians. And the social probability extracts spatio-temporal features directly on the new movement description to generate robust and accurate predicted results. The experiments on public benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Tracing the Influence of Predecessors on Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05634v1)** | 2023-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world traffic scenarios, agents such as pedestrians and car drivers often observe neighboring agents who exhibit similar behavior as examples and then mimic their actions to some extent in their own behavior. This information can serve as prior knowledge for trajectory prediction, which is unfortunately largely overlooked in current trajectory prediction models. This paper introduces a novel Predecessor-and-Successor (PnS) method that incorporates a predecessor tracing module to model the influence of predecessors (identified from concurrent neighboring agents) on the successor (target agent) within the same scene. The method utilizes the moving patterns of these predecessors to guide the predictor in trajectory prediction. PnS effectively aligns the motion encodings of the successor with multiple potential predecessors in a probabilistic manner, facilitating the decoding process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PnS by integrating it into a graph-based predictor for pedestrian trajectory prediction on the ETH/UCY datasets, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we replace the HD map-based scene-context module with our PnS method in a transformer-based predictor for vehicle trajectory prediction on the nuScenes dataset, showing that the predictor maintains good prediction performance even without relying on any map information.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBP: Path-based Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03750v2)** | 2024-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in the autonomous driving stack by enabling autonomous vehicles to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents. Goal-based prediction models have gained traction in recent years for addressing the multimodal nature of future trajectories. Goal-based prediction models simplify multimodal prediction by first predicting 2D goal locations of agents and then predicting trajectories conditioned on each goal. However, a single 2D goal location serves as a weak inductive bias for predicting the whole trajectory, often leading to poor map compliance, i.e., part of the trajectory going off-road or breaking traffic rules. In this paper, we improve upon goal-based prediction by proposing the Path-based prediction (PBP) approach. PBP predicts a discrete probability distribution over reference paths in the HD map using the path features and predicts trajectories in the path-relative Frenet frame. We applied the PBP trajectory decoder on top of the HiVT scene encoder and report results on the Argoverse dataset. Our experiments show that PBP achieves competitive performance on the standard trajectory prediction metrics, while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of map compliance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICRA 2024; Sepideh Afshar and Nachiket Deo contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Physically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14679v1)** | 2021-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future motion of actors in a traffic scene is a crucial part of any autonomous driving system. Recent research in this area has focused on trajectory prediction approaches that optimize standard trajectory error metrics. In this work, we describe three important properties -- physical realism guarantees, system maintainability, and sample efficiency -- which we believe are equally important for developing a self-driving system that can operate safely and practically in the real world. Furthermore, we introduce PTNet (PathTrackingNet), a novel approach for vehicle trajectory prediction that is a hybrid of the classical pure pursuit path tracking algorithm and modern graph-based neural networks. By combining a structured robotics technique with a flexible learning approach, we are able to produce a system that not only achieves the same level of performance as other state-of-the-art methods on traditional trajectory error metrics, but also provides strong guarantees about the physical realism of the predicted trajectories while requiring half the amount of data. We believe focusing on this new class of hybrid approaches is an useful direction for developing and maintaining a safety-critical autonomous driving system.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Trajectory Prediction via Counterfactual Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14202v1)** | 2021-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in complex dynamic environments plays a critical role in autonomous vehicles and intelligent robots. Most existing methods learn to predict future trajectories by behavior clues from history trajectories and interaction clues from environments. However, the inherent bias between training and deployment environments is ignored. Hence, we propose a counterfactual analysis method for human trajectory prediction to investigate the causality between the predicted trajectories and input clues and alleviate the negative effects brought by environment bias. We first build a causal graph for trajectory forecasting with history trajectory, future trajectory, and the environment interactions. Then, we cut off the inference from environment to trajectory by constructing the counterfactual intervention on the trajectory itself. Finally, we compare the factual and counterfactual trajectory clues to alleviate the effects of environment bias and highlight the trajectory clues. Our counterfactual analysis is a plug-and-play module that can be applied to any baseline prediction methods including RNN- and CNN-based ones. We show that our method achieves consistent improvement for different baselines and obtains the state-of-the-art results on public pedestrian trajectory forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2021.

| **[Probabilistic Trajectory Prediction with Structural Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04193v1)** | 2021-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the problem of predicting the motion trajectories of dynamic objects in the environment. Recent advances in predicting motion patterns often rely on machine learning techniques to extrapolate motion patterns from observed trajectories, with no mechanism to directly incorporate known rules. We propose a novel framework, which combines probabilistic learning and constrained trajectory optimisation. The learning component of our framework provides a distribution over future motion trajectories conditioned on observed past coordinates. This distribution is then used as a prior to a constrained optimisation problem which enforces chance constraints on the trajectory distribution. This results in constraint-compliant trajectory distributions which closely resemble the prior. In particular, we focus our investigation on collision constraints, such that extrapolated future trajectory distributions conform to the environment structure. We empirically demonstrate on real-world and simulated datasets the ability of our framework to learn complex probabilistic motion trajectories for motion data, while directly enforcing constraints to improve generalisability, producing more robust and higher quality trajectory distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at IROS 2021</p></details> |

In this work, we present a new model for human trajectory prediction which is able to take advantage of both human-human and human-space interactions. The future trajectory of humans, are generated by observing their past positions and interactions with the surroundings. To this end, we propose a "context-aware" recurrent neural network LSTM model, which can learn and predict human motion in crowded spaces such as a sidewalk, a museum or a shopping mall. We evaluate our model on a public pedestrian datasets, and we contribute a new challenging dataset that collects videos of humans that navigate in a (real) crowded space such as a big museum. Results show that our approach can predict human trajectories better when compared to previous state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMVC 2017</p></details> |

| **[Delving into Mapping Uncertainty for Mapless Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18498v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches, where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data, reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight, self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.

Mindful of these challenges we propose TribeFlow, a method designed to cope with the complex challenges of learning personalized predictive models of non-stationary, transient, and time-heterogeneous user trajectories. TribeFlow is a general method that can perform next product recommendation, next song recommendation, next location prediction, and general arbitrary-length user trajectory prediction without domain-specific knowledge.

| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

It is crucial for the AV to correctly understand and predict the future trajectories of pedestrians to avoid collision and plan a safe path. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories, relying on large amounts of annotated real-world data to learn pedestrian behavior. However, collecting and annotating these large real-world pedestrian datasets is costly in both time and labor. This paper describes a novel method using a stochastic sampling-based simulation to train DNNs for pedestrian trajectory prediction with social interaction. Our novel simulation method can generate vast amounts of automatically-annotated, realistic, and naturalistic synthetic pedestrian trajectories based on small amounts of real annotation. We then use such synthetic trajectories to train an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art deep learning approach Social GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to perform pedestrian trajectory prediction. Our proposed architecture, trained only using synthetic trajectories, achieves better prediction results compared to those trained on human-annotated real-world data using the same network. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of using simulation as a substitution for human annotation efforts to train high-performing prediction algorithms such as the DNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Incorporating Target Vehicle Trajectories Predicted by Deep Learning Into Model Predictive Controlled Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02843v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been widely applied to the motion planning of autonomous vehicles. An MPC-controlled vehicle is required to predict its own trajectories in a finite prediction horizon according to its model. Beyond this, the vehicle should also incorporate the prediction of the trajectory of its nearby vehicles, or target vehicles (TVs) into its decision-making. The conventional trajectory prediction methods, such as the constant-speed-based ones, are too trivial to accurately capture the potential collision risks. In this report, we propose a novel MPC-based motion planning method for an autonomous vehicle with a set of risk-aware constraints. These constraints incorporate the predicted trajectory of a TV learned using a deep-learning-based method. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to predict the TV's future trajectory based on its historical data. Then, the predicted TV trajectory is incorporated into the optimization of the MPC of the ego vehicle to generate collision-free motion. Simulation studies are conducted to showcase the prediction accuracy of the RNN model and the collision-free trajectories generated by the MPC.</p></details> |  |

This article presents an unsupervised method of ship movement trajectory prediction which represents the data in a three-dimensional space which consists of time difference between points, the scaled error distance between the tested and its predicted forward and backward locations, and the space-time angle. The representation feature space reduces the search scope for the next point to a collection of candidates which fit the local path prediction well, and therefore improve the accuracy. Unlike most statistical learning or deep learning methods, the proposed clustering-based trajectory reconstruction method does not require computationally expensive model training. This makes real-time reliable and accurate prediction feasible without using a training set. Our results show that the most prediction trajectories accurately consist of the true vessel paths.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future locations of vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, thus, has received a lot of attention in the recent years. While previous works have addressed modeling interactions with the static (obstacles) and dynamic (humans) environment agents, we address an important gap in trajectory prediction. We propose SafeCritic, a model that synergizes generative adversarial networks for generating multiple "real" trajectories with reinforcement learning to generate "safe" trajectories. The Discriminator evaluates the generated candidates on whether they are consistent with the observed inputs. The Critic network is environmentally aware to prune trajectories that are in collision or are in violation with the environment. The auto-encoding loss stabilizes training and prevents mode-collapse. We demonstrate results on two large scale data sets with a considerable improvement over state-of-the-art. We also show that the Critic is able to classify the safety of trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear as workshop paper for the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2019</p></details> |

Modern neural networks use the past trajectories of traffic participants as well as map data to gather hints about the possible driver intention and likely maneuvers. With increasing connectivity between cars and other traffic actors, cooperative information is another source of data that can be used as inputs for trajectory prediction algorithms. Connected actors might transmit their intended path or even complete planned trajectories to other actors, which simplifies the prediction problem due to the imposed constraints. In this work, we outline the benefits of using this source of data for trajectory prediction and propose a graph-based neural network architecture that can leverage this additional data. We show that the network performance increases substantially if cooperative data is present. Also, our proposed training scheme improves the network's performance even for cases where no cooperative information is available. We also show that the network can deal with inaccurate cooperative data, which allows it to be used in real automated driving environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 26th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2023</p></details> |

How an agent moves is affected by the various behaviors of its neighboring agents in different environments. To predict movements, we propose an end-to-end generative model named Attentive Maps Encoder Network (AMENet) that encodes the agent's motion and interaction information for accurate and realistic multi-path trajectory prediction. A conditional variational auto-encoder module is trained to learn the latent space of possible future paths based on attentive dynamic maps for interaction modeling and then is used to predict multiple plausible future trajectories conditioned on the observed past trajectories.

| **[RESET: Revisiting Trajectory Sets for Conditional Behavior Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05856v1)** | 2023-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is desirable to predict the behavior of traffic participants conditioned on different planned trajectories of the autonomous vehicle. This allows the downstream planner to estimate the impact of its decisions. Recent approaches for conditional behavior prediction rely on a regression decoder, meaning that coordinates or polynomial coefficients are regressed. In this work we revisit set-based trajectory prediction, where the probability of each trajectory in a predefined trajectory set is determined by a classification model, and first-time employ it to the task of conditional behavior prediction. We propose RESET, which combines a new metric-driven algorithm for trajectory set generation with a graph-based encoder. For unconditional prediction, RESET achieves comparable performance to a regression-based approach. Due to the nature of set-based approaches, it has the advantageous property of being able to predict a flexible number of trajectories without influencing runtime or complexity. For conditional prediction, RESET achieves reasonable results with late fusion of the planned trajectory, which was not observed for regression-based approaches before. This means that RESET is computationally lightweight to combine with a planner that proposes multiple future plans of the autonomous vehicle, as large parts of the forward pass can be reused.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2023 Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2023)</p></details> |

However, current methods are prone to making inconsistent and physically unrealistic predictions. We leverage insights from fluid dynamics to overcome this limitation by considering internal symmetry in real-world trajectories. We propose a novel model, Equivariant Continous COnvolution (ECCO) for improved trajectory prediction. ECCO uses rotationally-equivariant continuous convolutions to embed the symmetries of the system. On both vehicle and pedestrian trajectory datasets, ECCO attains competitive accuracy with significantly fewer parameters. It is also more sample efficient, generalizing automatically from few data points in any orientation. Lastly, ECCO improves generalization with equivariance, resulting in more physically consistent predictions. Our method provides a fresh perspective towards increasing trust and transparency in deep learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2021, 17 pages</p></details> |

Based on the demand for research on critical technologies for autonomous flying UAVs, this paper addresses the field of flight state recognition and trajectory prediction of UAVs. This paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy of UAV trajectory prediction based on UAV flight state recognition and verifies it using two prediction models. Firstly, UAV flight data acquisition and data preprocessing are carried out; secondly, UAV flight trajectory features are extracted based on data fusion and a UAV flight state recognition model based on PCA-DAGSVM model is established; finally, two UAV flight trajectory prediction models are established and the trajectory prediction errors of the two prediction models are compared and analyzed after flight state recognition. The results show that: 1) the UAV flight state recognition model based on PCA-DAGSVM has good recognition effect. 2) compared with the traditional UAV trajectory prediction model, the prediction model based on flight state recognition can effectively reduce the prediction error.</p></details> |  |

Existing models excel at predicting marginal trajectories for single agents, yet it remains an open question to jointly predict scene compliant trajectories over multiple agents. The challenge is due to exponentially increasing prediction space as a function of the number of agents. In this work, we exploit the underlying relations between interacting agents and decouple the joint prediction problem into marginal prediction problems. Our proposed approach M2I first classifies interacting agents as pairs of influencers and reactors, and then leverages a marginal prediction model and a conditional prediction model to predict trajectories for the influencers and reactors, respectively. The predictions from interacting agents are combined and selected according to their joint likelihoods. Experiments show that our simple but effective approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2022.

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

However, long-term prediction is still a major challenge for the current methods as the errors could accumulate along the way. Indeed, consistent and stable prediction far to the end of a trajectory inherently requires deeper analysis into the overall structure of that trajectory, which is related to the pedestrian's intention on the destination of the journey. In this work, we propose to model a hypothetical process that determines pedestrians' goals and the impact of such process on long-term future trajectories. We design Goal-driven Trajectory Prediction model - a dual-channel neural network that realizes such intuition. The two channels of the network take their dedicated roles and collaborate to generate future trajectories. Different than conventional goal-conditioned, planning-based methods, the model architecture is designed to generalize the patterns and work across different scenes with arbitrary geometrical and semantic structures. The model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art in various settings, especially in large prediction horizons. This result is another evidence for the effectiveness of adaptive structured representation of visual and geometrical features in human behavior analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2021</p></details> |

Both forward and backward trajectories follow the same social norms and obey the same physical constraints with the only difference in their time directions. Based on this unique property, we develop a new approach, called reciprocal learning, for human trajectory prediction. Two networks, forward and backward prediction networks, are tightly coupled, satisfying the reciprocal constraint, which allows them to be jointly learned. Based on this constraint, we borrow the concept of adversarial attacks of deep neural networks, which iteratively modifies the input of the network to match the given or forced network output, and develop a new method for network prediction, called reciprocal attack for matched prediction. It further improves the prediction accuracy. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our new method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for human trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Motion Indeterminacy Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13777v1)** | 2022-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human behavior has the nature of indeterminacy, which requires the pedestrian trajectory prediction system to model the multi-modality of future motion states. Unlike existing stochastic trajectory prediction methods which usually use a latent variable to represent multi-modality, we explicitly simulate the process of human motion variation from indeterminate to determinate. In this paper, we present a new framework to formulate the trajectory prediction task as a reverse process of motion indeterminacy diffusion (MID), in which we progressively discard indeterminacy from all the walkable areas until reaching the desired trajectory. This process is learned with a parameterized Markov chain conditioned by the observed trajectories. We can adjust the length of the chain to control the degree of indeterminacy and balance the diversity and determinacy of the predictions. Specifically, we encode the history behavior information and the social interactions as a state embedding and devise a Transformer-based diffusion model to capture the temporal dependencies of trajectories. Extensive experiments on the human trajectory prediction benchmarks including the Stanford Drone and ETH/UCY datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, enabling cars to anticipate the movements of surrounding objects for safe navigation. Trajectory prediction using Lidar point-cloud data performs better than 2D images due to providing 3D information. However, processing point-cloud data is more complicated and time-consuming than 2D images. Hence, state-of-the-art 3D trajectory predictions using point-cloud data suffer from slow and erroneous predictions. This paper introduces TrajectoryNAS, a pioneering method that focuses on utilizing point cloud data for trajectory prediction. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), TrajectoryNAS automates the design of trajectory prediction models, encompassing object detection, tracking, and forecasting in a cohesive manner. This approach not only addresses the complex interdependencies among these tasks but also emphasizes the importance of accuracy and efficiency in trajectory modeling. Through empirical studies, TrajectoryNAS demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant advancement in the field.Experimental results reveal that TrajcetoryNAS yield a minimum of 4.8 higger accuracy and 1.1* lower latency over competing methods on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  |

Different initiatives worldwide propose trajectory-oriented transformations that require high fidelity aircraft trajectory planning and prediction capabilities, supporting the trajectory life cycle at all stages efficiently. Recently proposed data-driven trajectory prediction approaches provide promising results.

Towards this goal we present a comprehensive framework comprising the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning state of the art method, in a pipeline with trajectory clustering and classification methods. This approach, compared to other approaches, can provide accurate predictions for the whole trajectory (i.e. with a prediction horizon until reaching the destination) both at the pre-tactical (i.e. starting at the departure airport at a specific time instant) and at the tactical (i.e. from any state while flying) stages, compared to state of the art approaches.</p></details> |  |

The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

| **[Diverse Multiple Trajectory Prediction Using a Two-stage Prediction Network Trained with Lane Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08641v2)** | 2023-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior arts in the field of motion predictions for autonomous driving tend to focus on finding a trajectory that is close to the ground truth trajectory. Such problem formulations and approaches, however, frequently lead to loss of diversity and biased trajectory predictions. Therefore, they are unsuitable for real-world autonomous driving where diverse and road-dependent multimodal trajectory predictions are critical for safety. To this end, this study proposes a novel loss function, \textit{Lane Loss}, that ensures map-adaptive diversity and accommodates geometric constraints. A two-stage trajectory prediction architecture with a novel trajectory candidate proposal module, \textit{Trajectory Prediction Attention (TPA)}, is trained with Lane Loss encourages multiple trajectories to be diversely distributed, covering feasible maneuvers in a map-aware manner. Furthermore, considering that the existing trajectory performance metrics are focusing on evaluating the accuracy based on the ground truth future trajectory, a quantitative evaluation metric is also suggested to evaluate the diversity of predicted multiple trajectories. The experiments performed on the Argoverse dataset show that the proposed method significantly improves the diversity of the predicted trajectories without sacrificing the prediction accuracy.</p></details> | RA-L accepted |
| **[CoverNet: Multimodal Behavior Prediction using Trajectory Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10298v2)** | 2020-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CoverNet, a new method for multimodal, probabilistic trajectory prediction for urban driving. Previous work has employed a variety of methods, including multimodal regression, occupancy maps, and 1-step stochastic policies. We instead frame the trajectory prediction problem as classification over a diverse set of trajectories. The size of this set remains manageable due to the limited number of distinct actions that can be taken over a reasonable prediction horizon. We structure the trajectory set to a) ensure a desired level of coverage of the state space, and b) eliminate physically impossible trajectories. By dynamically generating trajectory sets based on the agent's current state, we can further improve our method's efficiency. We demonstrate our approach on public, real-world self-driving datasets, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-Aware Attention for Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00062v1)** | 2022-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the possible future trajectories of the surrounding dynamic agents is an essential requirement in autonomous driving. These trajectories mainly depend on the surrounding static environment, as well as the past movements of those dynamic agents. Furthermore, the multimodal nature of agent intentions makes the trajectory prediction problem more challenging. All of the existing models consider the target agent as well as the surrounding agents similarly, without considering the variation of physical properties. In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning based framework for multimodal trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, which considers the physical properties of the target and surrounding vehicles such as the object class and their physical dimensions through a weighted attention module, that improves the accuracy of the predictions. Our model has achieved the highest results in the nuScenes trajectory prediction benchmark, out of the models which use rasterized maps to input environment information. Furthermore, our model is able to run in real-time, achieving a high inference rate of over 300 FPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ScePT: Scene-consistent, Policy-based Trajectory Predictions for Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13387v1)** | 2022-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a critical functionality of autonomous systems that share environments with uncontrolled agents, one prominent example being self-driving vehicles. Currently, most prediction methods do not enforce scene consistency, i.e., there are a substantial amount of self-collisions between predicted trajectories of different agents in the scene. Moreover, many approaches generate individual trajectory predictions per agent instead of joint trajectory predictions of the whole scene, which makes downstream planning difficult. In this work, we present ScePT, a policy planning-based trajectory prediction model that generates accurate, scene-consistent trajectory predictions suitable for autonomous system motion planning. It explicitly enforces scene consistency and learns an agent interaction policy that can be used for conditional prediction. Experiments on multiple real-world pedestrians and autonomous vehicle datasets show that ScePT} matches current state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with significantly improved scene consistency. We also demonstrate ScePT's ability to work with a downstream contingency planner.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPNet: Trajectory Proposal Network for Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12255v2)** | 2021-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making accurate motion prediction of the surrounding traffic agents such as pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists is crucial for autonomous driving. Recent data-driven motion prediction methods have attempted to learn to directly regress the exact future position or its distribution from massive amount of trajectory data. However, it remains difficult for these methods to provide multimodal predictions as well as integrate physical constraints such as traffic rules and movable areas. In this work we propose a novel two-stage motion prediction framework, Trajectory Proposal Network (TPNet). TPNet first generates a candidate set of future trajectories as hypothesis proposals, then makes the final predictions by classifying and refining the proposals which meets the physical constraints. By steering the proposal generation process, safe and multimodal predictions are realized. Thus this framework effectively mitigates the complexity of motion prediction problem while ensuring the multimodal output. Experiments on four large-scale trajectory prediction datasets, i.e. the ETH, UCY, Apollo and Argoverse datasets, show that TPNet achieves the state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

We first review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user behaviour. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a mixture of 2d Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density based clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first locations using a two step procedure: We first assign the new trajectory to the clusters it mot likely belongs. Secondly, we use characteristics from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on datasets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on two different datasets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt automatically to different subsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment. In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

| **[Prediction-based Online Trajectory Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06316v2)** | 2016-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent spatio-temporal data applications, such as car-shar\-ing and smart cities, impose new challenges regarding the scalability and timeliness of data processing systems. Trajectory compression is a promising approach for scaling up spatio-temporal databases. However, existing techniques fail to address the online setting, in which a compressed version of a trajectory stream has to be maintained over time. In this paper, we introduce ONTRAC, a new framework for map-matched online trajectory compression. ONTRAC learns prediction models for suppressing updates to a trajectory database using training data. Two prediction schemes are proposed, one for road segments via a Markov model and another for travel-times by combining Quadratic Programming and Expectation Maximization. Experiments show that ONTRAC outperforms the state-of-the-art offline technique even when long update delays (4 mininutes) are allowed and achieves up to 21 times higher compression ratio for travel-times. Moreover, our approach increases database scalability by up to one order of magnitude.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leapfrog Diffusion Model for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10895v1)** | 2023-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To model the indeterminacy of human behaviors, stochastic trajectory prediction requires a sophisticated multi-modal distribution of future trajectories. Emerging diffusion models have revealed their tremendous representation capacities in numerous generation tasks, showing potential for stochastic trajectory prediction. However, expensive time consumption prevents diffusion models from real-time prediction, since a large number of denoising steps are required to assure sufficient representation ability. To resolve the dilemma, we present LEapfrog Diffusion model (LED), a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction model, which provides real-time, precise, and diverse predictions. The core of the proposed LED is to leverage a trainable leapfrog initializer to directly learn an expressive multi-modal distribution of future trajectories, which skips a large number of denoising steps, significantly accelerating inference speed. Moreover, the leapfrog initializer is trained to appropriately allocate correlated samples to provide a diversity of predicted future trajectories, significantly improving prediction performances. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, including NBA/NFL/SDD/ETH-UCY, show that LED consistently improves performance and achieves 23.7%/21.9% ADE/FDE improvement on NFL. The proposed LED also speeds up the inference 19.3/30.8/24.3/25.1 times compared to the standard diffusion model on NBA/NFL/SDD/ETH-UCY, satisfying real-time inference needs.

We present a latent belief energy-based model (LB-EBM) for diverse human trajectory forecast. LB-EBM is a probabilistic model with cost function defined in the latent space to account for the movement history and social context. The low-dimensionality of the latent space and the high expressivity of the EBM make it easy for the model to capture the multimodality of pedestrian trajectory distributions. LB-EBM is learned from expert demonstrations (i.e., human trajectories) projected into the latent space. Sampling from or optimizing the learned LB-EBM yields a belief vector which is used to make a path plan, which then in turn helps to predict a long-range trajectory. The effectiveness of LB-EBM and the two-step approach are supported by strong empirical results. Our model is able to make accurate, multi-modal, and social compliant trajectory predictions and improves over prior state-of-the-arts performance on the Stanford Drone trajectory prediction benchmark by 10.9% and on the ETH-UCY benchmark by 27.6%.</p></details> | 13 pages |

While many prior works aim to achieve higher prediction accuracy, few study the adversarial robustness of their methods. To bridge this gap, we propose to study the adversarial robustness of data-driven trajectory prediction systems. We devise an optimization-based adversarial attack framework that leverages a carefully-designed differentiable dynamic model to generate realistic adversarial trajectories. Empirically, we benchmark the adversarial robustness of state-of-the-art prediction models and show that our attack increases the prediction error for both general metrics and planning-aware metrics by more than 50% and 37%. We also show that our attack can lead an AV to drive off road or collide into other vehicles in simulation. Finally, we demonstrate how to mitigate the adversarial attacks using an adversarial training scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ECCV 2022</p></details> |

While most prediction methods assume deterministic target motion, real-world targets often exhibit stochastic behaviors such as evasive maneuvers or random gliding patterns. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework based on Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) to model and predict such stochastic dynamics directly from trajectory data. The learned model generates probability distributions of future target positions conditioned on initial states and dynamic parameters, enabling efficient sampling and exact density evaluation. To provide deterministic surrogates compatible with existing guidance and planning algorithms, sampled trajectories are clustered using a time series k-means approach, yielding a set of representative "virtual target" trajectories. The method is target-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only trajectory data for training, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement for deterministic predictors. Simulated scenarios with maneuvering and ballistic targets demonstrate that the proposed approach bridges the gap between deterministic assumptions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted by Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics</p></details> |

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 pages, IROS2025</p></details> |

In this work we propose a data driven approach based on Markov Chains to generate synthetic trajectories, which are useful for training a multiple future trajectory predictor. The advantages are twofold: on the one hand synthetic samples can be used to augment existing datasets and train more effective predictors; on the other hand, it allows to generate samples with multiple ground truths, corresponding to diverse equally likely outcomes of the observed trajectory. We define a trajectory prediction model and a loss that explicitly address the multimodality of the problem and we show that combining synthetic and real data leads to prediction improvements, obtaining state of the art results.</p></details> | Accepted at ICPR2020 |
| **[An Ensemble Learning Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction in Interactive Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10617v2)** | 2022-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precisely modeling interactions and accurately predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles are essential to the decision-making and path-planning of intelligent vehicles. This paper proposes a novel framework based on ensemble learning to improve the performance of trajectory predictions in interactive scenarios. The framework is termed Interactive Ensemble Trajectory Predictor (IETP). IETP assembles interaction-aware trajectory predictors as base learners to build an ensemble learner. Firstly, each base learner in IETP observes historical trajectories of vehicles in the scene. Then each base learner handles interactions between vehicles to predict trajectories. Finally, an ensemble learner is built to predict trajectories by applying two ensemble strategies on the predictions from all base learners. Predictions generated by the ensemble learner are final outputs of IETP. In this study, three experiments using different data are conducted based on the NGSIM dataset. Experimental results show that IETP improves the predicting accuracy and decreases the variance of errors compared to base learners. In addition, IETP exceeds baseline models with 50% of the training data, indicating that IETP is data-efficient. Moreover, the implementation of IETP is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/IETP.</p></details> |  |

We argue that the goal of a moving agent may change over time, and modeling goals continuously provides more accurate and detailed information for future trajectory estimation. To this end, we present a recurrent network for trajectory prediction, called Stepwise Goal-Driven Network (SGNet). Unlike prior work that models only a single, long-term goal, SGNet estimates and uses goals at multiple temporal scales. In particular, it incorporates an encoder that captures historical information, a stepwise goal estimator that predicts successive goals into the future, and a decoder that predicts future trajectory. We evaluate our model on three first-person traffic datasets (HEV-I, JAAD, and PIE) as well as on three bird's eye view datasets (NuScenes, ETH, and UCY), and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets.

Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |

However, most works rely on a key assumption that each video is successfully preprocessed by detection and tracking algorithms and the complete observed trajectory is always available. However, in complex real-world environments, we often encounter miss-detection of target agents (e.g., pedestrian, vehicles) caused by the bad image conditions, such as the occlusion by other agents. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory prediction from incomplete observed trajectory due to miss-detection, where the observed trajectory includes several missing data points. We introduce a two-block RNN model that approximates the inference steps of the Bayesian filtering framework and seeks the optimal estimation of the hidden state when miss-detection occurs. The model uses two RNNs depending on the detection result. One RNN approximates the inference step of the Bayesian filter with the new measurement when the detection succeeds, while the other does the approximation when the detection fails. Our experiments show that the proposed model improves the prediction accuracy compared to the three baseline imputation methods on publicly available datasets: ETH and UCY ($9\%$ and $7\%$ improvement on the ADE and FDE metrics). We also show that our proposed method can achieve better prediction compared to the baselines when there is no miss-detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Towards Predicting Any Human Trajectory In Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00871v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic Transformer-based model that exploits diverse and numerous visual cues to predict human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes in the image plane, or body pose keypoints in either 2D or 3D. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Using masking technique, our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between agents based on the available visual cues. We delve into the merits of using 2D versus 3D poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and time-steps in the sequence are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications.

| **[Distilling Knowledge for Short-to-Long Term Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08553v4)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term trajectory forecasting is an important and challenging problem in the fields of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Social Interpretable Tree for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13296v1)** | 2022-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the multiple socially-acceptable future behaviors is an essential task for many vision applications. In this paper, we propose a tree-based method, termed as Social Interpretable Tree (SIT), to address this multi-modal prediction task, where a hand-crafted tree is built depending on the prior information of observed trajectory to model multiple future trajectories. Specifically, a path in the tree from the root to leaf represents an individual possible future trajectory. SIT employs a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy, in which the tree is first built by high-order velocity to balance the complexity and coverage of the tree and then optimized greedily to encourage multimodality. Finally, a teacher-forcing refining operation is used to predict the final fine trajectory. Compared with prior methods which leverage implicit latent variables to represent possible future trajectories, the path in the tree can explicitly explain the rough moving behaviors (e.g., go straight and then turn right), and thus provides better interpretability. Despite the hand-crafted tree, the experimental results on ETH-UCY and Stanford Drone datasets demonstrate that our method is capable of matching or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Interestingly, the experiments show that the raw built tree without training outperforms many prior deep neural network based approaches. Meanwhile, our method presents sufficient flexibility in long-term prediction and different best-of-$K$ predictions.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2022 |
| **[Adaptive Conformal Prediction Intervals Over Trajectory Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13362v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Aware Explainable Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16795v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in intelligent technologies have significantly improved navigation in complex traffic environments by enhancing environment perception and trajectory prediction for automated vehicles. However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

Inspired by the success of decoder-only models for language modeling, we propose DONUT, a Decoder-Only Network for Unrolling Trajectories. Unlike existing encoder-decoder forecasting models, we encode historical trajectories and predict future trajectories with a single autoregressive model. This allows the model to make iterative predictions in a consistent manner, and ensures that the model is always provided with up-to-date information, thereby enhancing performance. Furthermore, inspired by multi-token prediction for language modeling, we introduce an 'overprediction' strategy that gives the model the auxiliary task of predicting trajectories at longer temporal horizons. This allows the model to better anticipate the future and further improves performance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our decoder-only approach outperforms the encoder-decoder baseline, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Argoverse 2 single-agent motion forecasting benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Metamorphic Testing of Multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01294v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Predicting human trajectories is crucial for the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, such as automated vehicles and mobile robots. However, rigorously testing the underlying multimodal Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) models, which typically use multiple input sources (e.g., trajectory history and environment maps) and produce stochastic outputs (multiple possible future paths), presents significant challenges. The primary difficulty lies in the absence of a definitive test oracle, as numerous future trajectories might be plausible for any given scenario. Objectives: This research presents the application of Metamorphic Testing (MT) as a systematic methodology for testing multimodal HTP systems. We address the oracle problem through metamorphic relations (MRs) adapted for the complexities and stochastic nature of HTP. Methods: We present five MRs, targeting transformations of both historical trajectory data and semantic segmentation maps used as an environmental context. These MRs encompass: 1) label-preserving geometric transformations (mirroring, rotation, rescaling) applied to both trajectory and map inputs, where outputs are expected to transform correspondingly. 2) Map-altering transformations (changing semantic class labels, introducing obstacles) with predictable changes in trajectory distributions. We propose probabilistic violation criteria based on distance metrics between probability distributions, such as the Wasserstein or Hellinger distance. Conclusion: This study introduces tool, a MT framework for the oracle-less testing of multimodal, stochastic HTP systems. It allows for assessment of model robustness against input transformations and contextual changes without reliance on ground-truth trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infor...</summary><p>Information and Software Technology</p></details> |

However, existing pedestrian trajectory prediction methods still need more exploration to fully leverage these motion patterns. This paper investigates the possibilities of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve pedestrian trajectory prediction tasks by inducing motion cues. We introduce LG-Traj, a novel approach incorporating LLMs to generate motion cues present in pedestrian past/observed trajectories. Our approach also incorporates motion cues present in pedestrian future trajectories by clustering future trajectories of training data using a mixture of Gaussians. These motion cues, along with pedestrian coordinates, facilitate a better understanding of the underlying representation. Furthermore, we utilize singular value decomposition to augment the observed trajectories, incorporating them into the model learning process to further enhance representation learning. Our method employs a transformer-based architecture comprising a motion encoder to model motion patterns and a social decoder to capture social interactions among pedestrians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on popular pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmarks, namely ETH-UCY and SDD, and present various ablation experiments to validate our approach.</p></details> | Under Review |

Trajectory prediction is challenging because it requires reasoning about agents' past movements, social interactions among varying numbers and kinds of agents, constraints from the scene context, and the stochasticity of human behavior. Our approach models these interactions and constraints jointly within a novel Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF) network. Specifically, the model encodes multiple agents' past trajectories and the scene context into a Multi-Agent Tensor, then applies convolutional fusion to capture multiagent interactions while retaining the spatial structure of agents and the scene context. The model decodes recurrently to multiple agents' future trajectories, using adversarial loss to learn stochastic predictions. Experiments on both highway driving and pedestrian crowd datasets show that the model achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in CVPR 19: http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/html/Zhao_Multi-Agent_Tensor_Fusion_for_Contextual_Trajectory_Prediction_CVPR_2019_paper.html ; Architecture details available: https://github.com/programmingLearner/MATF-architecture-details</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phased Flight Trajectory Prediction with Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09033v1)** | 2022-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unprecedented increase of commercial airlines and private jets over the next ten years presents a challenge for air traffic control. Precise flight trajectory prediction is of great significance in air transportation management, which contributes to the decision-making for safe and orderly flights. Existing research and application mainly focus on the sequence generation based on historical trajectories, while the aircraft-aircraft interactions in crowded airspace especially the airspaces near busy airports have been largely ignored. On the other hand, there are distinct characteristics of aerodynamics for different flight phases, and the trajectory may be affected by various uncertainties such as weather and advisories from air traffic controllers. However, there is no literature fully considers all these issues. Therefore, we proposed a phased flight trajectory prediction framework. Multi-source and multi-modal datasets have been analyzed and mined using variants of recurrent neural network (RNN) mixture. To be specific, we first introduce spatio temporal graphs into the low-altitude airway prediction problem, and the motion constraints of an aircraft are embedded to the inference process for reliable forecasting results. In the en-route phase, the dual attention mechanism is employed to adaptively extract much more important features from overall datasets to learn the hidden patterns in dynamical environments. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed framework can outperform state-of-the-art methods for flight trajectory prediction for large passenger/transport airplanes.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CNNTOP: a CNN-based Trajectory Owner Prediction Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01185v1)** | 2020-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory owner prediction is the basis for many applications such as personalized recommendation, urban planning. Although much effort has been put on this topic, the results archived are still not good enough. Existing methods mainly employ RNNs to model trajectories semantically due to the inherent sequential attribute of trajectories. However, these approaches are weak at Point of Interest (POI) representation learning and trajectory feature detection. Thus, the performance of existing solutions is far from the requirements of practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN-based Trajectory Owner Prediction (CNNTOP) method. Firstly, we connect all POI according to trajectories from all users. The result is a connected graph that can be used to generate more informative POI sequences than other approaches. Secondly, we employ the Node2Vec algorithm to encode each POI into a low-dimensional real value vector. Then, we transform each trajectory into a fixed-dimensional matrix, which is similar to an image. Finally, a CNN is designed to detect features and predict the owner of a given trajectory. The CNN can extract informative features from the matrix representations of trajectories by convolutional operations, Batch normalization, and $K$-max pooling operations. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that CNNTOP substantially outperforms existing solutions in terms of macro-Precision, macro-Recall, macro-F1, and accuracy.</p></details> | 9pages, 11figures |

Existing methods usually assume the training and testing motions follow the same pattern while ignoring the potential distribution differences (e.g., shopping mall and street). This issue results in inevitable performance decrease. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transferable Graph Neural Network (T-GNN) framework, which jointly conducts trajectory prediction as well as domain alignment in a unified framework. Specifically, a domain-invariant GNN is proposed to explore the structural motion knowledge where the domain-specific knowledge is reduced. Moreover, an attention-based adaptive knowledge learning module is further proposed to explore fine-grained individual-level feature representations for knowledge transfer. By this way, disparities across different trajectory domains will be better alleviated. More challenging while practical trajectory prediction experiments are designed, and the experimental results verify the superior performance of our proposed model. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the pioneer which fills the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction across different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2022</p></details> |

Recently, many stochastic TP models have been proposed to deal with this problem and have achieved better performance than the traditional models with deterministic trajectory outputs. However, these stochastic models can generate a number of future trajectories with different qualities. They are lack of self-evaluation ability, that is, to examine the rationality of their prediction results, thus failing to guide users to identify high-quality ones from their candidate results. This hinders them from playing their best in real applications. In this paper, we make up for this defect and propose TPAD, a novel TP evaluation method based on the trajectory Anomaly Detection (AD) technique. In TPAD, we firstly combine the Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) technique and the experience in the AD and TP field to automatically design an effective trajectory AD model. Then, we utilize the learned trajectory AD model to examine the rationality of the predicted trajectories, and screen out good TP results for users. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that TPAD can effectively identify near-optimal prediction results, improving stochastic TP models' practical application effect.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, a diffusion-based generative model for multi-agent trajectory prediction is proposed. The model is capable of capturing the complex interactions between traffic participants and the environment, accurately learning the multimodal nature of the data. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed on large-scale datasets of real-world traffic scenarios, showing that our model outperforms several well-established methods in terms of prediction accuracy. By the incorporation of differential motion constraints on the model output, we illustrate that our model is capable of generating a diverse set of realistic future trajectories. Through the use of an interaction-aware guidance signal, we further demonstrate that the model can be adapted to predict the behavior of less cooperative agents, emphasizing its practical applicability under uncertain traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Existing trajectory predictions are fundamentally limited by lack of diversity in training data, which is difficult to acquire with sufficient coverage of possible modes. Our first contribution is an automatic method to simulate diverse trajectories in the top-view. It uses pre-existing datasets and maps as initialization, mines existing trajectories to represent realistic driving behaviors and uses a multi-agent vehicle dynamics simulator to generate diverse new trajectories that cover various modes and are consistent with scene layout constraints. Our second contribution is a novel method that generates diverse predictions while accounting for scene semantics and multi-agent interactions, with constant-time inference independent of the number of agents. We propose a convLSTM with novel state pooling operations and losses to predict scene-consistent states of multiple agents in a single forward pass, along with a CVAE for diversity. We validate our proposed multi-agent trajectory prediction approach by training and testing on the proposed simulated dataset and existing real datasets of traffic scenes. In both cases, our approach outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin, highlighting the benefits of both our diverse dataset simulation and constant-time diverse trajectory prediction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2020</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods.

In the presence of closely interacting people, however, this strategy fails to account for the dependencies between the different subject's motions. In this paper, we therefore introduce a motion prediction framework that explicitly reasons about the interactions of two observed subjects. Specifically, we achieve this by introducing a pairwise attention mechanism that models the mutual dependencies in the motion history of the two subjects. This allows us to preserve the long-term motion dynamics in a more realistic way and more robustly predict unusual and fast-paced movements, such as the ones occurring in a dance scenario. To evaluate this, and because no existing motion prediction datasets depict two closely-interacting subjects, we introduce the LindyHop600K dance dataset. Our results evidence that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art single person motion prediction techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>added...</summary><p>added reference for section 2</p></details> |

Previous effects achieve great empirical performance based on an encoding-decoding style. The methods of this style work by first encoding previous motions to latent representations and then decoding the latent representations into predicted motions. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including complicated loss constraints, cumbersome training processes, and scarce switch of different categories of motions in prediction. In this paper, to address the above issues, we jump out of the foregoing style and propose a novel framework from a new perspective. Specifically, our framework works in a masked completion fashion. In the training stage, we learn a motion diffusion model that generates motions from random noise. In the inference stage, with a denoising procedure, we make motion prediction conditioning on observed motions to output more continuous and controllable predictions. The proposed framework enjoys promising algorithmic properties, which only needs one loss in optimization and is trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, it accomplishes the switch of different categories of motions effectively, which is significant in realistic tasks, e.g., the animation task. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed framework.

Recent methods employ the latest hidden states of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the historical skeletons, which can only address short-term prediction. In this work, we propose a motion context modeling by summarizing the historical human motion with respect to the current prediction. A modified highway unit (MHU) is proposed for efficiently eliminating motionless joints and estimating next pose given the motion context. Furthermore, we enhance the motion dynamic by minimizing the gram matrix loss for long-term motion prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed model can promisingly forecast the human future movements, which yields superior performances over related state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, specifying the motion context with the activity labels enables our model to perform human motion transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2018</p></details> |

One aspect that has been obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a critical impact on the prediction results. Yet there is no effort that investigates across different pose representation schemes. We conduct an indepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on the motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon off-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input pose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN architecture termed AHMR (Attentive Hierarchical Motion Recurrent network) for motion prediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global context. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for the motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the widely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of articulate objects including human, fish, and mouse. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in short-term prediction and achieves much enhanced long-term prediction proficiency, such as retaining natural human-like motions over 50 seconds predictions.

Recent progress is mainly focused on estimating the activity of some specific elements like humans. In this paper, we leverage a neural motion field for estimating the motion of all points in a multiview setting. Modeling the motion from a dynamic scene with multiview data is challenging due to the ambiguities in points of similar color and points with time-varying color. We propose to regularize the estimated motion to be predictable. If the motion from previous frames is known, then the motion in the near future should be predictable. Therefore, we introduce a predictability regularization by first conditioning the estimated motion on latent embeddings, then by adopting a predictor network to enforce predictability on the embeddings.

| **[Uncertainty-aware Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03575v1)** | 2021-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction is essential for tasks such as human motion analysis and human-robot interactions. Most existing approaches have been proposed to realize motion prediction. However, they ignore an important task, the evaluation of the quality of the predicted result. It is far more enough for current approaches in actual scenarios because people can't know how to interact with the machine without the evaluation of prediction, and unreliable predictions may mislead the machine to harm the human. Hence, we propose an uncertainty-aware framework for human motion prediction (UA-HMP). Concretely, we first design an uncertainty-aware predictor through Gaussian modeling to achieve the value and the uncertainty of predicted motion. Then, an uncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty and reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for better performance. Our proposed framework is easily combined with current SOTA baselines to overcome their weakness in uncertainty modeling with slight parameters increment. Extensive experiments also show that they can achieve better performance in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap.</p></details> |  |

Due to the increasing development and understanding of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and the availability of large-scale human motion datasets, the human motion prediction has been remarkably advanced with a surge of interest among academia and industrial community. In this context, a comprehensive survey on 3D human motion prediction is conducted for the purpose of retrospecting and analyzing relevant works from existing released literature. In addition, a pertinent taxonomy is constructed to categorize these existing approaches for 3D human motion prediction. In this survey, relevant methods are categorized into three categories: human pose representation, network structure design, and \textit{prediction target}. We systematically review all relevant journal and conference papers in the field of human motion prediction since 2015, which are presented in detail based on proposed categorizations in this survey. Furthermore, the outline for the public benchmark datasets, evaluation criteria, and performance comparisons are respectively presented in this paper. The limitations of the state-of-the-art methods are discussed as well, hoping for paving the way for future explorations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Motion Prediction with Stacked Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11624v2)** | 2021-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting multiple plausible future trajectories of the nearby vehicles is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent motion prediction approaches attempt to achieve such multimodal motion prediction by implicitly regularizing the feature or explicitly generating multiple candidate proposals. However, it remains challenging since the latent features may concentrate on the most frequent mode of the data while the proposal-based methods depend largely on the prior knowledge to generate and select the proposals. In this work, we propose a novel transformer framework for multimodal motion prediction, termed as mmTransformer. A novel network architecture based on stacked transformers is designed to model the multimodality at feature level with a set of fixed independent proposals. A region-based training strategy is then developed to induce the multimodality of the generated proposals. Experiments on Argoverse dataset show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on motion prediction, substantially improving the diversity and the accuracy of the predicted trajectories.

Human motion prediction has traditionally been approached as a sequence prediction problem, leveraging historical human motion data to estimate future poses. Beginning with vanilla recurrent networks, the research community has investigated a variety of methods for learning human motion dynamics, encompassing graph-based and generative approaches. Despite these efforts, achieving accurate long-term predictions continues to be a significant challenge. In this regard, we present the Adversarial Motion Transformer (AdvMT), a novel model that integrates a transformer-based motion encoder and a temporal continuity discriminator. This combination effectively captures spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously within frames. With adversarial training, our method effectively reduces the unwanted artifacts in predictions, thereby ensuring the learning of more realistic and fluid human motions. The evaluation results indicate that AdvMT greatly enhances the accuracy of long-term predictions while also delivering robust short-term predictions</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

Despite the emergence of approaches for this task, comparing them is difficult due to the lack of standardized training settings and benchmark datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Person Interaction Motion (MI-Motion) Dataset, which includes skeleton sequences of multiple individuals collected by motion capture systems and refined and synthesized using a game engine. The dataset contains 167k frames of interacting people's skeleton poses and is categorized into 5 different activity scenes. To facilitate research in multi-person motion prediction, we also provide benchmarks to evaluate the performance of prediction methods in three settings: short-term, long-term, and ultra-long-term prediction. Additionally, we introduce a novel baseline approach that leverages graph and temporal convolutional networks, which has demonstrated competitive results in multi-person motion prediction. We believe that the proposed MI-Motion benchmark dataset and baseline will facilitate future research in this area, ultimately leading to better understanding and modeling of multi-person interactions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Snippet-to-Motion Progression for Skeleton-based Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14006v1)** | 2023-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Graph Convolutional Networks to achieve human motion prediction largely adopt a one-step scheme, which output the prediction straight from history input, failing to exploit human motion patterns. We observe that human motions have transitional patterns and can be split into snippets representative of each transition. Each snippet can be reconstructed from its starting and ending poses referred to as the transitional poses. We propose a snippet-to-motion multi-stage framework that breaks motion prediction into sub-tasks easier to accomplish. Each sub-task integrates three modules: transitional pose prediction, snippet reconstruction, and snippet-to-motion prediction. Specifically, we propose to first predict only the transitional poses. Then we use them to reconstruct the corresponding snippets, obtaining a close approximation to the true motion sequence. Finally we refine them to produce the final prediction output. To implement the network, we propose a novel unified graph modeling, which allows for direct and effective feature propagation compared to existing approaches which rely on separate space-time modeling. Extensive experiments on Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW datasets verify the effectiveness of our method which achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

A particular challenge is that motion prediction algorithms should obey dynamics constraints and quantify prediction uncertainty as a measure of confidence. We present a physics-constrained approach for motion prediction which uses a surrogate dynamical model to ensure that predicted trajectories are dynamically feasible. We propose a two-step integration consisting of intent and trajectory prediction subject to dynamics constraints. We also construct prediction regions that quantify uncertainty and are tailored for autonomous driving by using conformal prediction, a popular statistical tool. Physics Constrained Motion Prediction achieves a 41% better ADE, 56% better FDE, and 19% better IoU over a baseline in experiments using an autonomous racing dataset.</p></details> | Accepted at IV 2023 |

Whether based on recurrent or feed-forward neural networks, existing learning based methods fail to model the observation that human motion tends to repeat itself, even for complex sports actions and cooking activities. Here, we introduce an attention based feed-forward network that explicitly leverages this observation. In particular, instead of modeling frame-wise attention via pose similarity, we propose to extract motion attention to capture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical motion sub-sequences. In this context, we study the use of different types of attention, computed at joint, body part, and full pose levels. Aggregating the relevant past motions and processing the result with a graph convolutional network allows us to effectively exploit motion patterns from the long-term history to predict the future poses. Our experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW validate the benefits of our approach for both periodical and non-periodical actions. Thanks to our attention model, it yields state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.

Two popular methods, recurrent neural networks and feed-forward deep networks, are able to predict rough motion trend, but motion details such as limb movement may be lost. To predict more accurate future human motion, we propose an Adversarial Refinement Network (ARNet) following a simple yet effective coarse-to-fine mechanism with novel adversarial error augmentation. Specifically, we take both the historical motion sequences and coarse prediction as input of our cascaded refinement network to predict refined human motion and strengthen the refinement network with adversarial error augmentation. During training, we deliberately introduce the error distribution by learning through the adversarial mechanism among different subjects. In testing, our cascaded refinement network alleviates the prediction error from the coarse predictor resulting in a finer prediction robustly. This adversarial error augmentation provides rich error cases as input to our refinement network, leading to better generalization performance on the testing dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on three standard benchmark datasets and show that our proposed ARNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging aperiodic actions in both short-term and long-term predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACCV 2020(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[SLAMP: Stochastic Latent Appearance and Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02760v1)** | 2021-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion is an important cue for video prediction and often utilized by separating video content into static and dynamic components. Most of the previous work utilizing motion is deterministic but there are stochastic methods that can model the inherent uncertainty of the future. Existing stochastic models either do not reason about motion explicitly or make limiting assumptions about the static part. In this paper, we reason about appearance and motion in the video stochastically by predicting the future based on the motion history. Explicit reasoning about motion without history already reaches the performance of current stochastic models. The motion history further improves the results by allowing to predict consistent dynamics several frames into the future. Our model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art models on the generic video prediction datasets, however, significantly outperforms them on two challenging real-world autonomous driving datasets with complex motion and dynamic background.</p></details> | ICCV 2021 |

While training-free approaches have been explored, the recent release of the MotionFix dataset, which includes source-text-motion triplets, has opened new avenues for training, yielding promising results. However, existing methods struggle with precise control, often leading to misalignment between motion semantics and language instructions. In this paper, we introduce a related task, motion similarity prediction, and propose a multi-task training paradigm, where we train the model jointly on motion editing and motion similarity prediction to foster the learning of semantically meaningful representations. To complement this task, we design an advanced Diffusion-Transformer-based architecture that separately handles motion similarity prediction and motion editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach in both editing alignment and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://github.com/lzhyu/SimMotionEdit</p></details> |
| **[MMVP: Motion-Matrix-based Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16154v2)** | 2023-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge of video prediction lies where the system has to reason the objects' future motions from image frames while simultaneously maintaining the consistency of their appearances across frames. This work introduces an end-to-end trainable two-stream video prediction framework, Motion-Matrix-based Video Prediction (MMVP), to tackle this challenge. Unlike previous methods that usually handle motion prediction and appearance maintenance within the same set of modules, MMVP decouples motion and appearance information by constructing appearance-agnostic motion matrices. The motion matrices represent the temporal similarity of each and every pair of feature patches in the input frames, and are the sole input of the motion prediction module in MMVP. This design improves video prediction in both accuracy and efficiency, and reduces the model size. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that MMVP outperforms state-of-the-art systems on public data sets by non-negligible large margins (about 1 db in PSNR, UCF Sports) in significantly smaller model sizes (84% the size or smaller).</p></details> | ICCV 2023 (Oral) |
| **[R2-Diff: Denoising by diffusion as a refinement of retrieved motion for image-based motion prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09483v1)** | 2023-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based motion prediction is one of the essential techniques for robot manipulation. Among the various prediction models, we focus on diffusion models because they have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. In image-based motion prediction, diffusion models stochastically predict contextually appropriate motion by gradually denoising random Gaussian noise based on the image context. While diffusion models are able to predict various motions by changing the random noise, they sometimes fail to predict a contextually appropriate motion based on the image because the random noise is sampled independently of the image context. To solve this problem, we propose R2-Diff. In R2-Diff, a motion retrieved from a dataset based on image similarity is fed into a diffusion model instead of random noise. Then, the retrieved motion is refined through the denoising process of the diffusion model. Since the retrieved motion is almost appropriate to the context, it becomes easier to predict contextually appropriate motion. However, traditional diffusion models are not optimized to refine the retrieved motion. Therefore, we propose the method of tuning the hyperparameters based on the distance of the nearest neighbor motion among the dataset to optimize the diffusion model for refinement. Furthermore, we propose an image-based retrieval method to retrieve the nearest neighbor motion in inference. Our proposed retrieval efficiently computes the similarity based on the image features along the motion trajectory. We demonstrate that R2-Diff accurately predicts appropriate motions and achieves high task success rates compared to recent state-of-the-art models in robot manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, preprint submitted to Neurocomputing</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Motion Prediction via Neural Motion Message Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06594v1)** | 2020-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction is essential and challenging for autonomous vehicles and social robots. One challenge of motion prediction is to model the interaction among traffic actors, which could cooperate with each other to avoid collisions or form groups. To address this challenge, we propose neural motion message passing (NMMP) to explicitly model the interaction and learn representations for directed interactions between actors. Based on the proposed NMMP, we design the motion prediction systems for two settings: the pedestrian setting and the joint pedestrian and vehicle setting. Both systems share a common pattern: we use an individual branch to model the behavior of a single actor and an interactive branch to model the interaction between actors, while with different wrappers to handle the varied input formats and characteristics. The experimental results show that both systems outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods on several existing benchmarks. Besides, we provide interpretability for interaction learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2020 Oral</p></details> |

Human motion prediction focuses on forecasting future poses and movements from historical data, addressing challenges like nonlinear dynamics, occlusions, and motion style variations. Reconstruction aims to recover accurate 3D human body movements from visual inputs, often leveraging transformer-based architectures, diffusion models, and physical consistency losses to handle noise and complex poses. Motion generation synthesizes realistic and diverse motions from action labels, textual descriptions, or environmental constraints, with applications in robotics, gaming, and virtual avatars.

| **[Uniformly Accelerated Motion Model for Inter Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11541v2)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inter prediction is a key technology to reduce the temporal redundancy in video coding. In natural videos, there are usually multiple moving objects with variable velocity, resulting in complex motion fields that are difficult to represent compactly. In Versatile Video Coding (VVC), existing inter prediction methods usually assume uniform speed motion between consecutive frames and use the linear models for motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC), which may not well handle the complex motion fields in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce a uniformly accelerated motion model (UAMM) to exploit motion-related elements (velocity, acceleration) of moving objects between the video frames, and further combine them to assist the inter prediction methods to handle the variable motion in the temporal domain. Specifically, first, the theory of UAMM is mentioned. Second, based on that, we propose the UAMM-based parameter derivation and extrapolation schemes in the coding process. Third, we integrate the UAMM into existing inter prediction modes (Merge, MMVD, CIIP) to achieve higher prediction accuracy. The proposed method is implemented into the VVC reference software, VTM version 12.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 0.38% and on average 0.13% BD-rate reduction compared to the VTM anchor, under the Low-delay P configuration, with a slight increase of time complexity on the encoding/decoding side.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework designed to enhance motion representation. This framework consists of two stages: first, the network is pretrained through the self-reconstruction of past sequences, and the guided reconstruction of future sequences based on past movements. We design a velocity-based mask strategy to focus on the joints with large-scale moving. Subsequently, the pretrained network undergoes finetuning for specific tasks. Self-reconstruction, guided by patterns of past motion, substantially improves the model's ability to represent the spatiotemporal relationships among joints but also captures the latent relationships between past and future sequences. This capability is crucial for motion prediction tasks that solely depend on historical motion data. By employing this straightforward yet effective training paradigm, our method outperforms existing \textit{state-of-the-art} methods, reducing the average prediction errors by 8.8\% across Human3.6M, 3DPW, and AMASS datasets.

| **[Towards more realistic human motion prediction with attention to motion coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03584v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint relation modeling is a curial component in human motion prediction. Most existing methods rely on skeletal-based graphs to build the joint relations, where local interactive relations between joint pairs are well learned. However, the motion coordination, a global joint relation reflecting the simultaneous cooperation of all joints, is usually weakened because it is learned from part to whole progressively and asynchronously. Thus, the final predicted motions usually appear unrealistic. To tackle this issue, we learn a medium, called coordination attractor (CA), from the spatiotemporal features of motion to characterize the global motion features, which is subsequently used to build new relative joint relations. Through the CA, all joints are related simultaneously, and thus the motion coordination of all joints can be better learned. Based on this, we further propose a novel joint relation modeling module, Comprehensive Joint Relation Extractor (CJRE), to combine this motion coordination with the local interactions between joint pairs in a unified manner. Additionally, we also present a Multi-timescale Dynamics Extractor (MTDE) to extract enriched dynamics from the raw position information for effective prediction. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short- and long-term predictions on H3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW.</p></details> | Accepted by TCSVT |

For example, they cannot provide reliable predictions for scenes with a moving camera and independently moving foreground objects in driving scenarios. The existing methods fail to fully capture the dynamics of the structured world by only focusing on changes in pixels. In this paper, we assume that there is an underlying process creating observations in a video and propose to factorize it into static and dynamic components. We model the static part based on the scene structure and the ego-motion of the vehicle, and the dynamic part based on the remaining motion of the dynamic objects. By learning separate distributions of changes in foreground and background, we can decompose the scene into static and dynamic parts and separately model the change in each. Our experiments demonstrate that disentangling structure and motion helps stochastic video prediction, leading to better future predictions in complex driving scenarios on two real-world driving datasets, KITTI and Cityscapes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at TPAMI</p></details> |

In this paper we show that to achieve long term forecasting, predicting human pose at every time instant is unnecessary. Instead, it is more effective to predict a few keyposes and approximate intermediate ones by interpolating the keyposes. We demonstrate that our approach enables us to predict realistic motions for up to 5 seconds in the future, which is far longer than the typical 1 second encountered in the literature. Furthermore, because we model future keyposes probabilistically, we can generate multiple plausible future motions by sampling at inference time. Over this extended time period, our predictions are more realistic, more diverse and better preserve the motion dynamics than those state-of-the-art methods yield.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 3DV 2022.

Secondly, we apply a coarse-to-fine decoding strategy to decode the motions sequentially. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmark datasets for human motion prediction: Human3.6M and CMU motion capture dataset.

Compared with existing research, this task involves predicting less controlled, unpremeditated and pure reactive motions in response to external impact and how such motions can propagate through people. It brings new challenges such as data scarcity and predicting complex interactions. To this end, we propose a new method capitalizing differential physics and deep neural networks, leading to an explicit Latent Differential Physics (LDP) model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that LDP has high data efficiency, outstanding prediction accuracy, strong generalizability and good explainability. Since there is no similar research, a comprehensive comparison with 11 adapted baselines from several relevant domains is conducted, showing LDP outperforming existing research both quantitatively and qualitatively, improving prediction accuracy by as much as 70%, and demonstrating significantly stronger generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Headway Motion Control and Motion Prediction for Safe Unicycle Motion Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02760v1)** | 2023-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots that can be modeled as a kinematic unicycle are a standard mobile base platform for many service and logistics robots. Safe and smooth autonomous motion around obstacles is a crucial skill for unicycle robots to perform diverse tasks in complex environments. A classical control approach for unicycle control is feedback linearization using a headway point at a fixed headway distance in front of the unicycle. The unicycle headway control brings the headway point to a desired goal location by embedding a linear headway reference dynamics, which often results in an undesired offset for the actual unicycle position. In this paper, we introduce a new unicycle headway control approach with an adaptive headway distance that overcomes this limitation, i.e., when the headway point reaches the goal the unicycle position is also at the goal. By systematically analyzing the closed-loop unicycle motion under the adaptive headway controller, we design analytical feedback motion prediction methods that bound the closed-loop unicycle position trajectory and so can be effectively used for safety assessment and safe unicycle motion design around obstacles. We present an application of adaptive headway motion control and motion prediction for safe unicycle path following around obstacles in numerical simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, extended version of a paper submitted to a conference</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art formulate this problem as a sequence-to-sequence task, in which a historical of 3D skeletons feeds a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicts future movements, typically in the order of 1 to 2 seconds. However, one aspect that has been obviated so far, is the fact that human motion is inherently driven by interactions with objects and/or other humans in the environment. In this paper, we explore this scenario using a novel context-aware motion prediction architecture. We use a semantic-graph model where the nodes parameterize the human and objects in the scene and the edges their mutual interactions. These interactions are iteratively learned through a graph attention layer, fed with the past observations, which now include both object and human body motions. Once this semantic graph is learned, we inject it to a standard RNN to predict future movements of the human/s and object/s. We consider two variants of our architecture, either freezing the contextual interactions in the future of updating them. A thorough evaluation in the "Whole-Body Human Motion Database" shows that in both cases, our context-aware networks clearly outperform baselines in which the context information is not considered.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR20 |
| **[Learning Disentangled Representations for Controllable Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01388v1)** | 2022-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative model-based motion prediction techniques have recently realized predicting controlled human motions, such as predicting multiple upper human body motions with similar lower-body motions. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction. Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[History Repeats Itself: Human Motion Prediction via Motion Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11755v1)** | 2020-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction aims to forecast future human poses given a past motion. Whether based on recurrent or feed-forward neural networks, existing methods fail to model the observation that human motion tends to repeat itself, even for complex sports actions and cooking activities. Here, we introduce an attention-based feed-forward network that explicitly leverages this observation. In particular, instead of modeling frame-wise attention via pose similarity, we propose to extract motion attention to capture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical motion sub-sequences. Aggregating the relevant past motions and processing the result with a graph convolutional network allows us to effectively exploit motion patterns from the long-term history to predict the future poses. Our experiments on Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW evidence the benefits of our approach for both periodical and non-periodical actions. Thanks to our attention model, it yields state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/wei-mao-2019/HisRepItself.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2020 |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Branching for Motion Prediction using Motion Increments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01097v4)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction (HMP) has emerged as a popular research topic due to its diverse applications, but it remains a challenging task due to the stochastic and aperiodic nature of future poses. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

| **[TPNet: Trajectory Proposal Network for Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12255v2)** | 2021-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Making accurate motion prediction of the surrounding traffic agents such as pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists is crucial for autonomous driving. Recent data-driven motion prediction methods have attempted to learn to directly regress the exact future position or its distribution from massive amount of trajectory data. However, it remains difficult for these methods to provide multimodal predictions as well as integrate physical constraints such as traffic rules and movable areas. In this work we propose a novel two-stage motion prediction framework, Trajectory Proposal Network (TPNet). TPNet first generates a candidate set of future trajectories as hypothesis proposals, then makes the final predictions by classifying and refining the proposals which meets the physical constraints. By steering the proposal generation process, safe and multimodal predictions are realized. Thus this framework effectively mitigates the complexity of motion prediction problem while ensuring the multimodal output. Experiments on four large-scale trajectory prediction datasets, i.e. the ETH, UCY, Apollo and Argoverse datasets, show that TPNet achieves the state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoMoFormer: Social-Aware Motion Transformer for Multi-Person Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09224v2)** | 2023-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-person motion prediction remains a challenging problem, especially in the joint representation learning of individual motion and social interactions. Most prior methods only involve learning local pose dynamics for individual motion (without global body trajectory) and also struggle to capture complex interaction dependencies for social interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Social-Aware Motion Transformer (SoMoFormer) to effectively model individual motion and social interactions in a joint manner. Specifically, SoMoFormer extracts motion features from sub-sequences in displacement trajectory space to effectively learn both local and global pose dynamics for each individual. In addition, we devise a novel social-aware motion attention mechanism in SoMoFormer to further optimize dynamics representations and capture interaction dependencies simultaneously via motion similarity calculation across time and social dimensions. On both short- and long-term horizons, we empirically evaluate our framework on multi-person motion datasets and demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods of single- and multi-person motion prediction. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

We present a new method to correctly predict the uncertainty associated with the predicted distribution of future trajectories. Our approach, CovariaceNet, is based on a Conditional Generative Model with Gaussian latent variables in order to predict the parameters of a bi-variate Gaussian distribution. The combination of CovarianceNet with a motion prediction model results in a hybrid approach that outputs a uni-modal distribution. We will show how some state of the art methods in motion prediction become overconfident when predicting uncertainty, according to our proposed metric and validated in the ETH data-set \cite{pellegrini2009you}. CovarianceNet correctly predicts uncertainty, which makes our method suitable for applications that use predicted distributions, e.g., planning or decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotionRNN: A Flexible Model for Video Prediction with Spacetime-Varying Motions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02243v3)** | 2021-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles video prediction from a new dimension of predicting spacetime-varying motions that are incessantly changing across both space and time. Prior methods mainly capture the temporal state transitions but overlook the complex spatiotemporal variations of the motion itself, making them difficult to adapt to ever-changing motions. We observe that physical world motions can be decomposed into transient variation and motion trend, while the latter can be regarded as the accumulation of previous motions. Thus, simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios. MotionRNN has two main contributions. The first is that we design the MotionGRU unit, which can model the transient variation and motion trend in a unified way. The second is that we apply the MotionGRU to RNN-based predictive models and indicate a new flexible video prediction architecture with a Motion Highway that can significantly improve the ability to predict changeable motions and avoid motion vanishing for stacked multiple-layer predictive models. With high flexibility, this framework can adapt to a series of models for deterministic spatiotemporal prediction. Our MotionRNN can yield significant improvements on three challenging benchmarks for video prediction with spacetime-varying motions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMusion: Towards Consistent Stochastic Human Motion Prediction via Motion Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12554v3)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict multiple possible future human pose sequences from observed ones. Most prior works learn motion distributions through encoding-decoding in the latent space, which does not preserve motion's spatial-temporal structure. While effective, these methods often require complex, multi-stage training and yield predictions that are inconsistent with the provided history and can be physically unrealistic. To address these issues, we propose CoMusion, a single-stage, end-to-end diffusion-based stochastic HMP framework. CoMusion is inspired from the insight that a smooth future pose initialization improves prediction performance, a strategy not previously utilized in stochastic models but evidenced in deterministic works. To generate such initialization, CoMusion's motion predictor starts with a Transformer-based network for initial reconstruction of corrupted motion. Then, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to refine the prediction considering past observations in the discrete cosine transformation (DCT) space. Our method, facilitated by the Transformer-GCN module design and a proposed variance scheduler, excels in predicting accurate, realistic, and consistent motions, while maintaining appropriate diversity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoMusion surpasses prior methods across metrics, while demonstrating superior generation quality. Our Code is released at https://github.com/jsun57/CoMusion/ .</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

While this problem has recently received increasing attention, it has mostly been tackled for single humans in isolation. In this paper, we explore this problem when dealing with humans performing collaborative tasks, we seek to predict the future motion of two interacted persons given two sequences of their past skeletons. We propose a novel cross interaction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both persons, and learns to predict cross dependencies between the two pose sequences. Since no dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we collected ExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction), a new lab-based person interaction dataset of professional dancers performing Lindy-hop dancing actions, which contains 115 sequences with 30K frames annotated with 3D body poses and shapes. We thoroughly evaluate our cross interaction network on ExPI and show that both in short- and long-term predictions, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for single-person motion prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2022, update results of MSR in Table 3</p></details> |

Safe robot navigation around obstacles is an essential skill for such unicycle robots to perform diverse useful tasks in complex cluttered environments, especially around people and other robots. Fast and accurate safety assessment plays a key role in reactive and safe robot motion design. In this paper, as a more accurate and still simple alternative to the standard circular Lyapunov level sets, we introduce novel conic feedback motion prediction methods for bounding the close-loop motion trajectory of the kinematic unicycle robot model under a standard unicycle motion control approach. We present an application of unicycle feedback motion prediction for safe robot navigation around obstacles using reference governors, where the safety of a unicycle robot is continuously monitored based on the predicted future robot motion. We investigate the role of motion prediction on robot behaviour in numerical simulations and conclude that fast and accurate feedback motion prediction is key for fast, reactive, and safe robot navigation around obstacles.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, extended version of a paper submitted to a conference publication</p></details> |

To address the problem, in this work we propose FreqMRN, a human motion prediction framework that takes into account both the kinematic structure of the human body and the temporal smoothness nature of motion. Specifically, FreqMRN first generates a fixed-size motion history summary using a motion attention module, which helps avoid inaccurate motion predictions due to excessively long motion inputs. Then, supervised by the proposed spatial-temporal-aware, velocity-aware and global-smoothness-aware losses, FreqMRN iteratively refines the predicted motion though the proposed motion refinement module, which converts motion representations back and forth between pose space and frequency space. We evaluate FreqMRN on several standard benchmark datasets, including Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW. Experimental results demonstrate that FreqMRN outperforms previous methods by large margins for both short-term and long-term predictions, while demonstrating superior robustness.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, an accurate prediction depends on understanding both the scene context and human intentions. Even though many works study scene-aware human motion prediction, the latter is largely underexplored due to the lack of ego-centric views that disclose human intent and the limited diversity in motion and scenes. To reduce the gap, we propose a large-scale human motion dataset that delivers high-quality body pose sequences, scene scans, as well as ego-centric views with the eye gaze that serves as a surrogate for inferring human intent. By employing inertial sensors for motion capture, our data collection is not tied to specific scenes, which further boosts the motion dynamics observed from our subjects. We perform an extensive study of the benefits of leveraging the eye gaze for ego-centric human motion prediction with various state-of-the-art architectures. Moreover, to realize the full potential of the gaze, we propose a novel network architecture that enables bidirectional communication between the gaze and motion branches. Our network achieves the top performance in human motion prediction on the proposed dataset, thanks to the intent information from eye gaze and the denoised gaze feature modulated by the motion.

Key aspects of our proposed system include: 1) a novel, two-level processing architecture that aids in generating planned trajectories, 2) a simple set of easily computable features that integrate derivative information, and 3) a novel multi-objective loss function that helps the model to slowly progress from simple next-step prediction to the harder task of multi-step, closed-loop prediction. Our results demonstrate that these innovations improve the modeling of long-term motion trajectories. Finally, we propose a novel metric, called Normalized Power Spectrum Similarity (NPSS), to evaluate the long-term predictive ability of motion synthesis models, complementing the popular mean-squared error (MSE) measure of Euler joint angles over time. We conduct a user study to determine if the proposed NPSS correlates with human evaluation of long-term motion more strongly than MSE and find that it indeed does.

This is especially true in the case of few-shot learning, where we strive to forecast motion sequences for previously unseen actions based on only a few examples. Despite this, almost all related approaches for few-shot motion prediction do not incorporate the underlying graph, while it is a common component in classical motion prediction. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods for few-shot motion prediction are restricted to motion tasks with a fixed output space meaning these tasks are all limited to the same sensor graph. In this work, we propose to extend recent works on few-shot time-series forecasting with heterogeneous attributes with graph neural networks to introduce the first few-shot motion approach that explicitly incorporates the spatial graph while also generalizing across motion tasks with heterogeneous sensors. In our experiments on motion tasks with heterogeneous sensors, we demonstrate significant performance improvements with lifts from 10.4% up to 39.3% compared to best state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we show that our model can perform on par with the best approach so far when evaluating on tasks with a fixed output space while maintaining two magnitudes fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |

The main aspect of such applications is to guarantee safety for humans. To detect hazardous situations, current commercially available robotic systems rely on direct physical contact to the co-working person. To further advance this technology, there are multiple efforts to develop predictive capabilities for such systems. Using motion tracking sensors and pose estimation systems combined with adequate predictive models, potential episodes of hazardous collisions between humans and robots can be predicted. Based on the provided predictive information, the robotic system can avoid physical contact by adjusting speed or position. A potential approach for such systems is to perform human motion prediction with machine learning methods like Artificial Neural Networks. In our approach, the motion patterns of past seconds are used to predict future ones by applying a linear Tensor-on-Tensor regression model, selected according to a similarity measure between motion sequences obtained by Dynamic TimeWarping. For test and validation of our proposed approach, industrial pseudo assembly tasks were recorded with a motion capture system, providing unique traceable Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ for each human joint. The prediction of repetitive human motions associated with assembly tasks, whose data vary significantly in length and have highly correlated variables, has been achieved in real time.</p></details> |  |

This, coupled with partial information in novel environments, makes it challenging to employ classical motion planning approaches at test time. Our key insight is to cast it as a learning problem to leverage past experience of solving similar planning problems to directly predict motion plans for mobile manipulation tasks in novel situations at test time. To enable this, we develop a simulator, ArtObjSim, that simulates articulated objects placed in real scenes. We then introduce SeqIK+$θ_0$, a fast and flexible representation for motion plans. Finally, we learn models that use SeqIK+$θ_0$ to quickly predict motion plans for articulating novel objects at test time. Experimental evaluation shows improved speed and accuracy at generating motion plans than pure search-based methods and pure learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in ICRA 2023.

It can also provide useful early-warning information for offshore operations that are critical with regard to motion. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) -based machine learning model was developed to predict heave and surge motions of a semi-submersible. The training and test data came from a model test carried out in the deep-water ocean basin, at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. The motion and measured waves were fed into LSTM cells and then went through serval fully connected (FC) layers to obtain the prediction. With the help of measured waves, the prediction extended 46.5 s into future with an average accuracy close to 90%. Using a noise-extended dataset, the trained model effectively worked with a noise level up to 0.8. As a further step, the model could predict motions only based on the motion itself. Based on sensitive studies on the architectures of the model, guidelines for the construction of the machine learning model are proposed. The proposed LSTM model shows a strong ability to predict vessel wave-excited motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 22 figures, submitted to Applied Ocean Research</p></details> |

Future scene parsing and optical flow estimation are two key tasks that help agents better understand their environments as the former provides dense semantic information, i.e. what objects will be present and where they will appear, while the latter provides dense motion information, i.e. how the objects will move. In this paper, we propose a novel model to simultaneously predict scene parsing and optical flow in unobserved future video frames. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt in jointly predicting scene parsing and motion dynamics. In particular, scene parsing enables structured motion prediction by decomposing optical flow into different groups while optical flow estimation brings reliable pixel-wise correspondence to scene parsing. By exploiting this mutually beneficial relationship, our model shows significantly better parsing and motion prediction results when compared to well-established baselines and individual prediction models on the large-scale Cityscapes dataset. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can be used to predict the steering angle of the vehicles, which further verifies the ability of our model to learn latent representations of scene dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NIPS 2017</p></details> |
| **[Improving Human Motion Prediction Through Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00544v1)** | 2021-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction is an essential component for enabling closer human-robot collaboration. The task of accurately predicting human motion is non-trivial. It is compounded by the variability of human motion, both at a skeletal level due to the varying size of humans and at a motion level due to individual movement's idiosyncrasies. These variables make it challenging for learning algorithms to obtain a general representation that is robust to the diverse spatio-temporal patterns of human motion. In this work, we propose a modular sequence learning approach that allows end-to-end training while also having the flexibility of being fine-tuned. Our approach relies on the diversity of training samples to first learn a robust representation, which can then be fine-tuned in a continual learning setup to predict the motion of new subjects. We evaluated the proposed approach by comparing its performance against state-of-the-art baselines. The results suggest that our approach outperforms other methods over all the evaluated temporal horizons, using a small amount of data for fine-tuning. The improved performance of our approach opens up the possibility of using continual learning for personalized and reliable motion prediction.</p></details> |  |

In earlier work, which did not integrate camera motion into the vision model, prediction was impaired and camera movement suffered from undesired feedback effects. Here we detail the integration of camera motion into the predictive learning system and show improved visual prediction and saccadic behavior. From these experiences, we speculate on the integration of additional sensory and motor systems into self-supervised, predictive learning models.</p></details> |  |

However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art method requires learning several mappings for diversity and a dedicated model for controllable motion prediction. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep generative network for both diverse and controllable motion prediction. To this end, we leverage the intuition that realistic human motions consist of smooth sequences of valid poses, and that, given limited data, learning a pose prior is much more tractable than a motion one. We therefore design a generator that predicts the motion of different body parts sequentially, and introduce a normalizing flow based pose prior, together with a joint angle loss, to achieve motion realism.Our experiments on two standard benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and HumanEva-I, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both sample diversity and accuracy.

Therefore, prediction of 3D point clouds has great significance for intelligent vehicles, which can be utilized for numerous further applications. However, due to point clouds are unordered and unstructured, point cloud prediction is challenging and has not been deeply explored in current literature. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-based neural network named MoNet. The key idea of the proposed MoNet is to integrate motion features between two consecutive point clouds into the prediction pipeline. The introduction of motion features enables the model to more accurately capture the variations of motion information across frames and thus make better predictions for future motion. In addition, content features are introduced to model the spatial content of individual point clouds. A recurrent neural network named MotionRNN is proposed to capture the temporal correlations of both features. Besides, we propose an attention-based motion align module to address the problem of missing motion features in the inference pipeline. Extensive experiments on two large scale outdoor LiDAR datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed MoNet. Moreover, we perform experiments on applications using the predicted point clouds and the results indicate the great application potential of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for motion forecasting or motion generation rely solely on either prior motions or text prompts, facing limitations with precision or control, particularly over extended durations. The multi-modal nature of our approach enhances the contextual understanding of human motion, while our graph-based transformer framework effectively capture both spatial and temporal motion dynamics. As a result, our model consistently outperforms existing generative techniques in accurately predicting long-term motions. Additionally, by leveraging diffusion models' ability to capture different modes of prediction, we estimate uncertainty, significantly improving spatial awareness in human-robot interactions by incorporating zones of presence with varying confidence levels for each body joint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 - HuMoGen.

However, the inexplicability and uncertainty of complex artificial intelligence models may lead to unpredictable failures of the motion prediction module, which may mislead the system to make unsafe decisions. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to guarantee reliable autonomous driving, where failure detection is a potential direction. Uncertainty estimates can be used to quantify the degree of confidence a model has in its predictions and may be valuable for failure detection. We propose a framework of failure detection for motion prediction from the uncertainty perspective, considering both motion uncertainty and model uncertainty, and formulate various uncertainty scores according to different prediction stages. The proposed approach is evaluated based on different motion prediction algorithms, uncertainty estimation methods, uncertainty scores, etc., and the results show that uncertainty is promising for failure detection for motion prediction but should be used with caution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2023)</p></details> |

Following the success of deep learning methods in several computer vision tasks, recent work has focused on using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model human motion, with the goal of learning time-dependent representations that perform tasks such as short-term motion prediction and long-term human motion synthesis. We examine recent work, with a focus on the evaluation methodologies commonly used in the literature, and show that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by a simple baseline that does not attempt to model motion at all. We investigate this result, and analyze recent RNN methods by looking at the architectures, loss functions, and training procedures used in state-of-the-art approaches. We propose three changes to the standard RNN models typically used for human motion, which result in a simple and scalable RNN architecture that obtains state-of-the-art performance on human motion prediction.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR 17 |
| **[Robust Predictive Motion Planning by Learning Obstacle Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06222v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe motion planning for robotic systems in dynamic environments is nontrivial in the presence of uncertain obstacles, where estimation of obstacle uncertainties is crucial in predicting future motions of dynamic obstacles. The worst-case characterization gives a conservative uncertainty prediction and may result in infeasible motion planning for the ego robotic system. In this paper, an efficient, robust, and safe motion-planing algorithm is developed by learning the obstacle uncertainties online. More specifically, the unknown yet intended control set of obstacles is efficiently computed by solving a linear programming problem. The learned control set is used to compute forward reachable sets of obstacles that are less conservative than the worst-case prediction. Based on the forward prediction, a robust model predictive controller is designed to compute a safe reference trajectory for the ego robotic system that remains outside the reachable sets of obstacles over the prediction horizon. The method is applied to a car-like mobile robot in both simulations and hardware experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Map-Predictive Motion Planning in Unknown Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08184v1)** | 2019-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms for motion planning in unknown environments are generally limited in their ability to reason about the structure of the unobserved environment. As such, current methods generally navigate unknown environments by relying on heuristic methods to choose intermediate objectives along frontiers. We present a unified method that combines map prediction and motion planning for safe, time-efficient autonomous navigation of unknown environments by dynamically-constrained robots. We propose a data-driven method for predicting the map of the unobserved environment, using the robot's observations of its surroundings as context. These map predictions are then used to plan trajectories from the robot's position to the goal without requiring frontier selection. We demonstrate that our map-predictive motion planning strategy yields a substantial improvement in trajectory time over a naive frontier pursuit method and demonstrates similar performance to methods using more sophisticated frontier selection heuristics with significantly shorter computation time.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMP: Autoregressive Motion Prediction Revisited with Next Token Prediction for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13331v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an essential task in autonomous driving (AD), motion prediction aims to predict the future states of surround objects for navigation. One natural solution is to estimate the position of other agents in a step-by-step manner where each predicted time-step is conditioned on both observed time-steps and previously predicted time-steps, i.e., autoregressive prediction. Pioneering works like SocialLSTM and MFP design their decoders based on this intuition. However, almost all state-of-the-art works assume that all predicted time-steps are independent conditioned on observed time-steps, where they use a single linear layer to generate positions of all time-steps simultaneously. They dominate most motion prediction leaderboards due to the simplicity of training MLPs compared to autoregressive networks. In this paper, we introduce the GPT style next token prediction into motion forecasting. In this way, the input and output could be represented in a unified space and thus the autoregressive prediction becomes more feasible. However, different from language data which is composed of homogeneous units -words, the elements in the driving scene could have complex spatial-temporal and semantic relations. To this end, we propose to adopt three factorized attention modules with different neighbors for information aggregation and different position encoding styles to capture their relations, e.g., encoding the transformation between coordinate systems for spatial relativity while adopting RoPE for temporal relativity. Empirically, by equipping with the aforementioned tailored designs, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Waymo Open Motion and Waymo Interaction datasets. Notably, AMP outperforms other recent autoregressive motion prediction methods: MotionLM and StateTransformer, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Trajectory Dependencies for Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05436v3)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction, i.e., forecasting future body poses given observed pose sequence, has typically been tackled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer from prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network for motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and spatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose to encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the range of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done in previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal kinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of using a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional network to learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the network to capture long range dependencies beyond that of human kinematic tree. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets for motion prediction, including Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state of the art performance, and is applicable to both angle-based and position-based pose representations.

| **[DivDiff: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Diverse Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00014v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse human motion prediction (HMP) aims to predict multiple plausible future motions given an observed human motion sequence. It is a challenging task due to the diversity of potential human motions while ensuring an accurate description of future human motions. Current solutions are either low-diversity or limited in expressiveness. Recent denoising diffusion models (DDPM) hold potential generative capabilities in generative tasks. However, introducing DDPM directly into diverse HMP incurs some issues. Although DDPM can increase the diversity of the potential patterns of human motions, the predicted human motions become implausible over time because of the significant noise disturbances in the forward process of DDPM. This phenomenon leads to the predicted human motions being hard to control, seriously impacting the quality of predicted motions and restricting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To alleviate this, we propose a novel conditional diffusion-based generative model, called DivDiff, to predict more diverse and realistic human motions. Specifically, the DivDiff employs DDPM as our backbone and incorporates Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and transformer mechanisms to encode the observed human motion sequence as a condition to instruct the reverse process of DDPM. More importantly, we design a diversified reinforcement sampling function (DRSF) to enforce human skeletal constraints on the predicted human motions. DRSF utilizes the acquired information from human skeletal as prior knowledge, thereby reducing significant disturbances introduced during the forward process. Extensive results received in the experiments on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patient-Specific Autoregressive Models for Organ Motion Prediction in Radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11832v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiotherapy often involves a prolonged treatment period. During this time, patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Prediction of Vehicle Semantic Intention and Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03629v1)** | 2018-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the possible behaviors of traffic participants is an essential capability for future autonomous vehicles. The majority of current researches fix the number of driving intentions by considering only a specific scenario. However, distinct driving environments usually contain various possible driving maneuvers. Therefore, a intention prediction method that can adapt to different traffic scenarios is needed. To further improve the overall vehicle prediction performance, motion information is usually incorporated with classified intentions. As suggested in some literature, the methods that directly predict possible goal locations can achieve better performance for long-term motion prediction than other approaches due to their automatic incorporation of environment constraints. Moreover, by obtaining the temporal information of the predicted destinations, the optimal trajectories for predicted vehicles as well as the desirable path for ego autonomous vehicle could be easily generated. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-based Intention and Motion Prediction (SIMP) method, which can be adapted to any driving scenarios by using semantic-defined vehicle behaviors. It utilizes a probabilistic framework based on deep neural network to estimate the intentions, final locations, and the corresponding time information for surrounding vehicles. An exemplar real-world scenario was used to implement and examine the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the 2018 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles (IV) Symposium</p></details> |

We are interested in developing transfer learning algorithms that can be trained on the pedestrian trajectories collected at one intersection and yet still provide accurate predictions of the trajectories at another, previously unseen intersection. We first discussed the feature selection for transferable pedestrian motion models in general. Following this discussion, we developed one transferable pedestrian motion prediction algorithm based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that infers pedestrian intentions and predicts future trajectories based on observed trajectory. We evaluated our algorithm on a dataset collected at two intersections, trained at one intersection and tested at the other intersection. We used the accuracy of augmented semi-nonnegative sparse coding (ASNSC), trained and tested at the same intersection as a baseline. The result shows that the proposed algorithm improves the baseline accuracy by 40% in the non-transfer task, and 16% in the transfer task.</p></details> |  |

To effectively handle complex evolution of pixels in videos, we propose to decompose the motion and content, two key components generating dynamics in videos. Our model is built upon the Encoder-Decoder Convolutional Neural Network and Convolutional LSTM for pixel-level prediction, which independently capture the spatial layout of an image and the corresponding temporal dynamics. By independently modeling motion and content, predicting the next frame reduces to converting the extracted content features into the next frame content by the identified motion features, which simplifies the task of prediction. Our model is end-to-end trainable over multiple time steps, and naturally learns to decompose motion and content without separate training. We evaluate the proposed network architecture on human activity videos using KTH, Weizmann action, and UCF-101 datasets. We show state-of-the-art performance in comparison to recent approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end trainable network architecture with motion and content separation to model the spatiotemporal dynamics for pixel-level future prediction in natural videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2017</p></details> |

In this work we propose a deep learning framework for human motion capture data that learns a generic representation from a large corpus of motion capture data and generalizes well to new, unseen, motions. Using an encoding-decoding network that learns to predict future 3D poses from the most recent past, we extract a feature representation of human motion. Most work on deep learning for sequence prediction focuses on video and speech. Since skeletal data has a different structure, we present and evaluate different network architectures that make different assumptions about time dependencies and limb correlations. To quantify the learned features, we use the output of different layers for action classification and visualize the receptive fields of the network units. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art in skeletal motion prediction even though these use action specific training data. Our results show that deep feedforward networks, trained from a generic mocap database, can successfully be used for feature extraction from human motion data and that this representation can be used as a foundation for classification and prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017</p></details> |
| **[Human Motion Prediction using Semi-adaptable Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00781v2)** | 2019-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction is an important component to facilitate human robot interaction. Robots need to accurately predict human's future movement in order to safely plan its own motion trajectories and efficiently collaborate with humans. Many recent approaches predict human's movement using deep learning methods, such as recurrent neural networks. However, existing methods lack the ability to adapt to time-varying human behaviors, and many of them do not quantify uncertainties in the prediction. This paper proposes an approach that uses a semi-adaptable neural network for human motion prediction, and provides uncertainty bounds of the predictions in real time. In particular, a neural network is trained offline to represent the human motion transition model, and then recursive least square parameter adaptation algorithm (RLS-PAA) is adopted for online parameter adaptation of the neural network and for uncertainty estimation. Experiments on several human motion datasets verify that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in terms of prediction accuracy and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceive, Interact, Predict: Learning Dynamic and Static Clues for End-to-End Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02181v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction is highly relevant to the perception of dynamic objects and static map elements in the scenarios of autonomous driving. In this work, we propose PIP, the first end-to-end Transformer-based framework which jointly and interactively performs online mapping, object detection and motion prediction. PIP leverages map queries, agent queries and mode queries to encode the instance-wise information of map elements, agents and motion intentions, respectively. Based on the unified query representation, a differentiable multi-task interaction scheme is proposed to exploit the correlation between perception and prediction. Even without human-annotated HD map or agent's historical tracking trajectory as guidance information, PIP realizes end-to-end multi-agent motion prediction and achieves better performance than tracking-based and HD-map-based methods. PIP provides comprehensive high-level information of the driving scene (vectorized static map and dynamic objects with motion information), and contributes to the downstream planning and control. Code and models will be released for facilitating further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Map and Agent Geometry for Autonomous Driving Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13922v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, deep learning enabled motion prediction is a popular topic. A critical gap in traditional motion prediction methodologies lies in ensuring equivariance under Euclidean geometric transformations and maintaining invariant interaction relationships. This research introduces a groundbreaking solution by employing EqMotion, a theoretically geometric equivariant and interaction invariant motion prediction model for particles and humans, plus integrating agent-equivariant high-definition (HD) map features for context aware motion prediction in autonomous driving. The use of EqMotion as backbone marks a significant departure from existing methods by rigorously ensuring motion equivariance and interaction invariance. Equivariance here implies that an output motion must be equally transformed under the same Euclidean transformation as an input motion, while interaction invariance preserves the manner in which agents interact despite transformations. These properties make the network robust to arbitrary Euclidean transformations and contribute to more accurate prediction. In addition, we introduce an equivariant method to process the HD map to enrich the spatial understanding of the network while preserving the overall network equivariance property. By applying these technologies, our model is able to achieve high prediction accuracy while maintain a lightweight design and efficient data utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Semantic Latent Directions for Accurate and Controllable Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11494v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of stochastic human motion prediction (SHMP), researchers have often turned to generative models like GANS, VAEs and diffusion models. However, most previous approaches have struggled to accurately predict motions that are both realistic and coherent with past motion due to a lack of guidance on the latent distribution. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Latent Directions (SLD) as a solution to this challenge, aiming to constrain the latent space to learn meaningful motion semantics and enhance the accuracy of SHMP. SLD defines a series of orthogonal latent directions and represents the hypothesis of future motion as a linear combination of these directions. By creating such an information bottleneck, SLD excels in capturing meaningful motion semantics, thereby improving the precision of motion predictions. Moreover, SLD offers controllable prediction capabilities by adjusting the coefficients of the latent directions during the inference phase. Expanding on SLD, we introduce a set of motion queries to enhance the diversity of predictions. By aligning these motion queries with the SLD space, SLD is further promoted to more accurate and coherent motion predictions. Through extensive experiments conducted on widely used benchmarks, we showcase the superiority of our method in accurately predicting motions while maintaining a balance of realism and diversity.

However, it is challenging to capture these features due to the subtle transitions involved in the complex human motions. This paper introduces MotionWavelet, a human motion prediction framework that utilizes Wavelet Transformation and studies human motion patterns in the spatial-frequency domain. In MotionWavelet, a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) learns a Wavelet Manifold by applying Wavelet Transformation on the motion data therefore encoding the intricate spatial and temporal motion patterns. Once the Wavelet Manifold is built, WDM trains a diffusion model to generate human motions from Wavelet latent vectors. In addition to the WDM, MotionWavelet also presents a Wavelet Space Shaping Guidance mechanism to refine the denoising process to improve conformity with the manifold structure.

| **[Physics-constrained Attack against Convolution-based Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11990v3)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction has achieved a brilliant performance with the help of convolution-based neural networks. However, currently, there is no work evaluating the potential risk in human motion prediction when facing adversarial attacks. The adversarial attack will encounter problems against human motion prediction in naturalness and data scale. To solve the problems above, we propose a new adversarial attack method that generates the worst-case perturbation by maximizing the human motion predictor's prediction error with physical constraints. Specifically, we introduce a novel adaptable scheme that facilitates the attack to suit the scale of the target pose and two physical constraints to enhance the naturalness of the adversarial example. The evaluating experiments on three datasets show that the prediction errors of all target models are enlarged significantly, which means current convolution-based human motion prediction models are vulnerable to the proposed attack. Based on the experimental results, we provide insights on how to enhance the adversarial robustness of the human motion predictor and how to improve the adversarial attack against human motion prediction.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional motion prediction approaches, iMotion-LLM capitalizes on textual instructions as key inputs for generating contextually relevant trajectories. By enriching the real-world driving scenarios in the Waymo Open Dataset with textual motion instructions, we created InstructWaymo. Leveraging this dataset, iMotion-LLM integrates a pretrained LLM, fine-tuned with LoRA, to translate scene features into the LLM input space. iMotion-LLM offers significant advantages over conventional motion prediction models. First, it can generate trajectories that align with the provided instructions if it is a feasible direction. Second, when given an infeasible direction, it can reject the instruction, thereby enhancing safety. These findings act as milestones in empowering autonomous navigation systems to interpret and predict the dynamics of multi-agent environments, laying the groundwork for future advancements in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion and Context-Aware Audio-Visual Conditioned Video Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04679v3)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing state-of-the-art method for audio-visual conditioned video prediction uses the latent codes of the audio-visual frames from a multimodal stochastic network and a frame encoder to predict the next visual frame. However, a direct inference of per-pixel intensity for the next visual frame is extremely challenging because of the high-dimensional image space. To this end, we decouple the audio-visual conditioned video prediction into motion and appearance modeling. The multimodal motion estimation predicts future optical flow based on the audio-motion correlation. The visual branch recalls from the motion memory built from the audio features to enable better long term prediction. We further propose context-aware refinement to address the diminishing of the global appearance context in the long-term continuous warping. The global appearance context is extracted by the context encoder and manipulated by motion-conditioned affine transformation before fusion with features of warped frames. Experimental results show that our method achieves competitive results on existing benchmarks.</p></details> | BMVC 2023 |

Video frames are naturally generated by the inherent pixel flows from preceding frames based on the appearance and motion dynamics in the video. However, existing methods focus on directly hallucinating pixel values, resulting in blurry predictions. In this paper, we develop a dual motion Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) architecture, which learns to explicitly enforce future-frame predictions to be consistent with the pixel-wise flows in the video through a dual-learning mechanism. The primal future-frame prediction and dual future-flow prediction form a closed loop, generating informative feedback signals to each other for better video prediction. To make both synthesized future frames and flows indistinguishable from reality, a dual adversarial training method is proposed to ensure that the future-flow prediction is able to help infer realistic future-frames, while the future-frame prediction in turn leads to realistic optical flows. Our dual motion GAN also handles natural motion uncertainty in different pixel locations with a new probabilistic motion encoder, which is based on variational autoencoders. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed dual motion GAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on synthesizing new video frames and predicting future flows. Our model generalizes well across diverse visual scenes and shows superiority in unsupervised video representation learning.</p></details> | ICCV 17 camera ready |
| **[Aggregated Multi-GANs for Controlled 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09755v1)** | 2021-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction from historical pose sequence is at the core of many applications in machine intelligence. However, in current state-of-the-art methods, the predicted future motion is confined within the same activity. One can neither generate predictions that differ from the current activity, nor manipulate the body parts to explore various future possibilities. Undoubtedly, this greatly limits the usefulness and applicability of motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a generalization of the human motion prediction task in which control parameters can be readily incorporated to adjust the forecasted motion. Our method is compelling in that it enables manipulable motion prediction across activity types and allows customization of the human movement in a variety of fine-grained ways. To this aim, a simple yet effective composite GAN structure, consisting of local GANs for different body parts and aggregated via a global GAN is presented. The local GANs game in lower dimensions, while the global GAN adjusts in high dimensional space to avoid mode collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art.

| **[Group-based Motion Prediction for Navigation in Crowded Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11637v5)** | 2022-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on the problem of planning the motion of a robot in a dynamic multiagent environment such as a pedestrian scene. Enabling the robot to navigate safely and in a socially compliant fashion in such scenes requires a representation that accounts for the unfolding multiagent dynamics. Existing approaches to this problem tend to employ microscopic models of motion prediction that reason about the individual behavior of other agents. While such models may achieve high tracking accuracy in trajectory prediction benchmarks, they often lack an understanding of the group structures unfolding in crowded scenes. Inspired by the Gestalt theory from psychology, we build a Model Predictive Control framework (G-MPC) that leverages group-based prediction for robot motion planning. We conduct an extensive simulation study involving a series of challenging navigation tasks in scenes extracted from two real-world pedestrian datasets. We illustrate that G-MPC enables a robot to achieve statistically significantly higher safety and lower number of group intrusions than a series of baselines featuring individual pedestrian motion prediction models. Finally, we show that G-MPC can handle noisy lidar-scan estimates without significant performance losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>5th A...</summary><p>5th Annual Conference on Robot Learning. 2021</p></details> |
| **[Weakly-supervised Action Transition Learning for Stochastic Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15608v1)** | 2022-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the task of action-driven stochastic human motion prediction, which aims to predict multiple plausible future motions given a sequence of action labels and a short motion history. This differs from existing works, which predict motions that either do not respect any specific action category, or follow a single action label. In particular, addressing this task requires tackling two challenges: The transitions between the different actions must be smooth; the length of the predicted motion depends on the action sequence and varies significantly across samples. As we cannot realistically expect training data to cover sufficiently diverse action transitions and motion lengths, we propose an effective training strategy consisting of combining multiple motions from different actions and introducing a weak form of supervision to encourage smooth transitions. We then design a VAE-based model conditioned on both the observed motion and the action label sequence, allowing us to generate multiple plausible future motions of varying length. We illustrate the generality of our approach by exploring its use with two different temporal encoding models, namely RNNs and Transformers. Our approach outperforms baseline models constructed by adapting state-of-the-art single action-conditioned motion generation methods and stochastic human motion prediction approaches to our new task of action-driven stochastic motion prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/wei-mao-2019/WAT.</p></details> | CVPR2022 (Oral) |

Our approach uses offline learning of human actions along with temporal coherence to predict the human actions. Our intention-aware online planning algorithm uses the learned database to compute a reliable trajectory based on the predicted actions. We represent the predicted human motion using a Gaussian distribution and compute tight upper bounds on collision probabilities for safe motion planning. We also describe novel techniques to account for noise in human motion prediction. We highlight the performance of our planning algorithm in complex simulated scenarios and real world benchmarks with 7-DOF robot arms operating in a workspace with a human performing complex tasks. We demonstrate the benefits of our intention-aware planner in terms of computing safe trajectories in such uncertain environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Human Motion Prediction via A Bayesian Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06564v1)** | 2021-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction is an important and challenging topic that has promising prospects in efficient and safe human-robot-interaction systems. Currently, the majority of the human motion prediction algorithms are based on deterministic models, which may lead to risky decisions for robots. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic model for human motion prediction in this paper. The key idea of our approach is to extend the conventional deterministic motion prediction neural network to a Bayesian one. On one hand, our model could generate several future motions when given an observed motion sequence. On the other hand, by calculating the Epistemic Uncertainty and the Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty, our model could tell the robot if the observation has been seen before and also give the optimal result among all possible predictions. We extensively validate our approach on a large scale benchmark dataset Human3.6m. The experiments show that our approach performs better than deterministic methods. We further evaluate our approach in a Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) scenario. The experimental results show that our approach makes the interaction more efficient and safer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2021</p></details> |
| **[Structured Prediction Helps 3D Human Motion Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09070v1)** | 2019-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction is a challenging and important task in many computer vision application domains. Existing work only implicitly models the spatial structure of the human skeleton. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the prediction into individual joints by means of a structured prediction layer that explicitly models the joint dependencies. This is implemented via a hierarchy of small-sized neural networks connected analogously to the kinematic chains in the human body as well as a joint-wise decomposition in the loss function. The proposed layer is agnostic to the underlying network and can be used with existing architectures for motion modelling. Prior work typically leverages the H3.6M dataset. We show that some state-of-the-art techniques do not perform well when trained and tested on AMASS, a recently released dataset 14 times the size of H3.6M. Our experiments indicate that the proposed layer increases the performance of motion forecasting irrespective of the base network, joint-angle representation, and prediction horizon. We furthermore show that the layer also improves motion predictions qualitatively. We make code and models publicly available at https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2019/spl.</p></details> | ICCV 2019 |
| **[DriveMRP: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Synthetic Motion Data for Motion Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02948v3)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures.

An architecture that combines an RNN encoder-decoder and mixture density networks (MDNs) is developed to model the conditional distribution over future motion given past motion. We show that the learned encodings naturally cluster according to high-level activities, and we demonstrate the usefulness of these learned encodings in the context of information retrieval, where a database of surgical motion is searched for suturing activity using a motion-based query. Future prediction with MDNs is found to significantly outperform simpler baselines as well as the best previously-published result for this task, advancing state-of-the-art performance from an F1 score of 0.60 +- 0.14 to 0.77 +- 0.05.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2018</p></details> |
| **[PRANK: motion Prediction based on RANKing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12007v2)** | 2021-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the motion of agents such as pedestrians or human-driven vehicles is one of the most critical problems in the autonomous driving domain. The overall safety of driving and the comfort of a passenger directly depend on its successful solution. The motion prediction problem also remains one of the most challenging problems in autonomous driving engineering, mainly due to high variance of the possible agent's future behavior given a situation. The two phenomena responsible for the said variance are the multimodality caused by the uncertainty of the agent's intent (e.g., turn right or move forward) and uncertainty in the realization of a given intent (e.g., which lane to turn into). To be useful within a real-time autonomous driving pipeline, a motion prediction system must provide efficient ways to describe and quantify this uncertainty, such as computing posterior modes and their probabilities or estimating density at the point corresponding to a given trajectory. It also should not put substantial density on physically impossible trajectories, as they can confuse the system processing the predictions. In this paper, we introduce the PRANK method, which satisfies these requirements. PRANK takes rasterized bird-eye images of agent's surroundings as an input and extracts features of the scene with a convolutional neural network. It then produces the conditional distribution of agent's trajectories plausible in the given scene. The key contribution of PRANK is a way to represent that distribution using nearest-neighbor methods in latent trajectory space, which allows for efficient inference in real time. We evaluate PRANK on the in-house and Argoverse datasets, where it shows competitive results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2020</p></details> |
| **[From Crowd Motion Prediction to Robot Navigation in Crowds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01424v1)** | 2023-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on robot navigation in crowded environments. To navigate safely and efficiently within crowds, robots need models for crowd motion prediction. Building such models is hard due to the high dimensionality of multiagent domains and the challenge of collecting or simulating interaction-rich crowd-robot demonstrations. While there has been important progress on models for offline pedestrian motion forecasting, transferring their performance on real robots is nontrivial due to close interaction settings and novelty effects on users. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a recent state-of-the-art motion prediction model (S-GAN) for crowd navigation tasks. We incorporate this model into a model predictive controller (MPC) and deploy it on a self-balancing robot which we subject to a diverse range of crowd behaviors in the lab. We demonstrate that while S-GAN motion prediction accuracy transfers to the real world, its value is not reflected on navigation performance, measured with respect to safety and efficiency; in fact, the MPC performs indistinguishably even when using a simple constant-velocity prediction model, suggesting that substantial model improvements might be needed to yield significant gains for crowd navigation tasks.

| **[Safety-aware Motion Prediction with Unseen Vehicles for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01510v1)** | 2021-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction of vehicles is critical but challenging due to the uncertainties in complex environments and the limited visibility caused by occlusions and limited sensor ranges. In this paper, we study a new task, safety-aware motion prediction with unseen vehicles for autonomous driving. Unlike the existing trajectory prediction task for seen vehicles, we aim at predicting an occupancy map that indicates the earliest time when each location can be occupied by either seen and unseen vehicles. The ability to predict unseen vehicles is critical for safety in autonomous driving. To tackle this challenging task, we propose a safety-aware deep learning model with three new loss functions to predict the earliest occupancy map. Experiments on the large-scale autonomous driving nuScenes dataset show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on the safety-aware motion prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first one that can predict the existence of unseen vehicles in most cases.

| **[Robot Motion Prediction by Channel State Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03829v1)** | 2023-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robotic systems have gained a lot of attention, in recent years. However, accurate prediction of robot motion in indoor environments with limited visibility is challenging. While vision-based and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors are commonly used for motion detection and localization of robotic arms, they are privacy-invasive and depend on a clear line-of-sight (LOS) for precise measurements. In cases where additional sensors are not available or LOS is not possible, these technologies may not be the best option. This paper proposes a novel method that employs channel state information (CSI) from WiFi signals affected by robotic arm motion. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify four different activities of a Franka Emika robotic arm. The implemented method seeks to accurately predict robot motion even in scenarios in which the robot is obscured by obstacles, without relying on any attached or internal sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, MLSP Conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Person 3D Motion Prediction with Multi-Range Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12073v1)** | 2021-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for multi-person 3D motion trajectory prediction. Our key observation is that a human's action and behaviors may highly depend on the other persons around. Thus, instead of predicting each human pose trajectory in isolation, we introduce a Multi-Range Transformers model which contains of a local-range encoder for individual motion and a global-range encoder for social interactions. The Transformer decoder then performs prediction for each person by taking a corresponding pose as a query which attends to both local and global-range encoder features. Our model not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on long-term 3D motion prediction, but also generates diverse social interactions. More interestingly, our model can even predict 15-person motion simultaneously by automatically dividing the persons into different interaction groups.
