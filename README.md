| **[STF: Spatial Temporal Fusion for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18149v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a challenging task that aims to predict the future trajectory of vehicles or pedestrians over a short time horizon based on their historical positions. The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective, advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction. To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution, a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[STRAP: Spatial-Temporal Risk-Attentive Vehicle Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08563v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vehicle trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safety and efficiency in fully autonomous driving systems. While existing methods primarily focus on modeling observed motion patterns and interactions with other vehicles, they often neglect the potential risks posed by the uncertain or aggressive behaviors of surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal risk-attentive trajectory prediction framework that incorporates a risk potential field to assess perceived risks arising from behaviors of nearby vehicles. The framework leverages a spatial-temporal encoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential field into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for trajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to improve the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative spacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate that our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2% respectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk scenarios. The proposed framework provides interpretable, risk-aware predictions, contributing to more robust decision-making for autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[GoalNet: Goal Areas Oriented Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19002v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians on the road is an important task for autonomous driving. The pedestrian trajectory prediction is affected by scene paths, pedestrian's intentions and decision-making, which is a multi-modal problem. Most recent studies use past trajectories to predict a variety of potential future trajectory distributions, which do not account for the scene context and pedestrian targets. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, we propose to use scene context and observed trajectory to predict the goal points first, and then reuse the goal points to predict the future trajectories. By leveraging the information from scene context and observed trajectory, the uncertainty can be limited to a few target areas, which represent the "goals" of the pedestrians. In this paper, we propose GoalNet, a new trajectory prediction neural network based on the goal areas of a pedestrian. Our network can predict both pedestrian's trajectories and bounding boxes. The overall model is efficient and modular, and its outputs can be changed according to the usage scenario. Experimental results show that GoalNet significantly improves the previous state-of-the-art performance by 48.7% on the JAAD and 40.8% on the PIE dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPK: Trustworthy Trajectory Prediction Integrating Prior Knowledge For Interpretability and Kinematic Feasibility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06743v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users. However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge, like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025) for oral presentation.

| **[Boundary-Guided Trajectory Prediction for Road Aware and Physically Feasible Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06740v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories. Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate under adversarial attacks from 66% to just 1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Neural Parameter-varying Data-enabled Predictive Control of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08259v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like tip-to-surface distance, presents considerable challenges for achieving robust and reliable real-time control. To address these issues, this paper presents the Neural Parameter-Varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC) framework. By integrating hyper neural networks (hypernets) into the neural Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) paradigm, the proposed method adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, updates the neural feature space accordingly, and enables efficient and accurate trajectory prediction and control. The NPV-DeePC framework is validated through extensive simulations involving surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery. The results highlight its ability to outperform existing controllers in terms of accuracy and adaptability. The computational efficiency of the NPV-DeePC approach makes it a viable candidate for real-time applications. These findings underscore its potential to advance the safe and precise control of APPJs and provide a scalable solution for other parameter-varying nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Scaling with Reflective Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01951v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which obtains OpenAI o3-mini's performance via the new Reflective Generative Form. The new form focuses on high-quality reasoning trajectory selection and contains two novelties: 1) A unified interface for policy and process reward model: we share the backbone network and use task-specific heads for reasoning trajectory predicting and scoring respectively, introducing only 53M extra parameters for trajectory scoring. 2) Eliminating the reliance on process-level annotation: we provide a self-supervised process reward model, which can directly learn the high-quality reasoning trajectory selection from the outcome reward. Equipped with the reflective generative form, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable for test-time scaling, and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low, medium, and high) based on the controllable thinking length. Experiments demonstrate that our MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI o3-mini's series with only 32B parameter size. To support the research community, we have open-sourced MetaStone-S1 at https://github.com/MetaStone-AI/MetaStone-S1.</p></details> |  |
| **[ILNet: Trajectory Prediction with Inverse Learning Attention for Enhancing Intention Capture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06531v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination, capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL) attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments, introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[GC-GAT: Multimodal Vehicular Trajectory Prediction using Graph Goal Conditioning and Cross-context Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11150v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of surrounding vehicles heavily relies on what contextual information is given to a motion prediction model. The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach. Several prediction examples are available at https://frommarginaltojointpred.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems 2025 (ITSC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Features: How Dataset Design Influences Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05098v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation, yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied. This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4 Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTMSformer: A Local Trend-Aware Attention and Motion State Encoding Transformer for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04634v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been challenging to model the complex temporal-spatial dependencies between agents for trajectory prediction. As each state of an agent is closely related to the states of adjacent time steps, capturing the local temporal dependency is beneficial for prediction, while most studies often overlook it. Besides, learning the high-order motion state attributes is expected to enhance spatial interaction modeling, but it is rarely seen in previous works. To address this, we propose a lightweight framework, LTMSformer, to extract temporal-spatial interaction features for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Specifically, we introduce a Local Trend-Aware Attention mechanism to capture the local temporal dependency by leveraging a convolutional attention mechanism with hierarchical local time boxes. Next, to model the spatial interaction dependency, we build a Motion State Encoder to incorporate high-order motion state attributes, such as acceleration, jerk, heading, etc. To further refine the trajectory prediction, we propose a Lightweight Proposal Refinement Module that leverages Multi-Layer Perceptrons for trajectory embedding and generates the refined trajectories with fewer model parameters. Experiment results on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline HiVT-64, reducing the minADE by approximately 4.35%, the minFDE by 8.74%, and the MR by 20%. We also achieve higher accuracy than HiVT-128 with a 68% reduction in model size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Conditional Random Field for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18198v2)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is of significant importance in computer vision. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction benefits autonomous vehicles and robots in planning their motion. Pedestrians' trajectories are greatly influenced by their intentions. Prior studies having introduced various deep learning methods only pay attention to the spatial and temporal information of trajectory, overlooking the explicit intention information. In this study, we introduce a novel model, termed the \textbf{S-T CRF}: \textbf{S}patial-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{R}andom \textbf{F}ield, which judiciously incorporates intention information besides spatial and temporal information of trajectory. This model uses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to generate a representation of future intentions, greatly improving the prediction of subsequent trajectories when combined with spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, the study innovatively devises a space CRF loss and a time CRF loss, meticulously designed to enhance interaction constraints and temporal dynamics, respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations on dataset ETH/UCY and SDD demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses existing baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMD: Adaptive Momentum and Decoupled Contrastive Learning Framework for Robust Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01801v2)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module, our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy, allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajFlow: Multi-modal Motion Prediction via Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08541v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.</p></details> | IROS 2025 |
| **[Enhanced accuracy through ensembling of randomly initialized auto-regressive models for time-dependent PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03863v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) require computationally intensive numerical solvers to predict spatiotemporal field evolution. While machine learning (ML) surrogates offer faster solutions, autoregressive inference with ML models suffer from error accumulation over successive predictions, limiting their long-term accuracy. We propose a deep ensemble framework to address this challenge, where multiple ML surrogate models with random weight initializations are trained in parallel and aggregated during inference. This approach leverages the diversity of model predictions to mitigate error propagation while retaining the autoregressive strategies ability to capture the system's time dependent relations. We validate the framework on three PDE-driven dynamical systems - stress evolution in heterogeneous microstructures, Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion, and planetary-scale shallow water system - demonstrating consistent reduction in error accumulation over time compared to individual models. Critically, the method requires only a few time steps as input, enabling full trajectory predictions with inference times significantly faster than numerical solvers. Our results highlight the robustness of ensemble methods in diverse physical systems and their potential as efficient and accurate alternatives to traditional solvers. The codes for this work are available on GitHub (https://github.com/Graham-Brady-Research-Group/AutoregressiveEnsemble_SpatioTemporal_Evolution).</p></details> | 29 Pages |
| **[Label-Free Long-Horizon 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction via Motion-Aligned RGB and Event Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03365v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction, reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance to support reproducible research in the robotics community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Consistency in Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Through Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02406v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[LANet: A Lane Boundaries-Aware Approach For Robust Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01308v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

The reduced 6G latency coupled with edge processing infrastructure will for the first time provide a realistic offloading scenario in cellular networks where several computationally intensive functions, including rendering, can migrate from the user device and into the network.

| **[MMHU: A Massive-Scale Multimodal Benchmark for Human Behavior Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12463v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are integral components of the transportation ecosystem, and understanding their behaviors is crucial to facilitating the development of safe driving systems. Although recent progress has explored various aspects of human behavior$\unicode{x2014}$such as motion, trajectories, and intention$\unicode{x2014}$a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating human behavior understanding in autonomous driving remains unavailable. In this work, we propose $\textbf{MMHU}$, a large-scale benchmark for human behavior analysis featuring rich annotations, such as human motion and trajectories, text description for human motions, human intention, and critical behavior labels relevant to driving safety. Our dataset encompasses 57k human motion clips and 1.73M frames gathered from diverse sources, including established driving datasets such as Waymo, in-the-wild videos from YouTube, and self-collected data. A human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline is developed to generate rich behavior captions.

| **[Fully Unified Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12667v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically learn only from expert planning data collected from a single ego vehicle, severely limiting the diversity of learnable driving policies and scenarios. However, a critical yet overlooked fact is that in any driving scenario, multiple high-quality trajectories from other vehicles coexist with a specific ego vehicle's trajectory. Existing methods fail to fully exploit this valuable resource, missing important opportunities to improve the models' performance (including long-tail scenarios) through learning from other experts. Intuitively, Jointly learning from both ego and other vehicles' expert data is beneficial for planning tasks. However, this joint learning faces two critical challenges. (1) Different scene observation perspectives across vehicles hinder inter-vehicle alignment of scene feature representations; (2) The absence of partial modality in other vehicles' data (e.g., vehicle states) compared to ego-vehicle data introduces learning bias. To address these challenges, we propose FUMP (Fully Unified Motion Planning), a novel two-stage trajectory generation framework. Building upon probabilistic decomposition, we model the planning task as a specialized subtask of motion prediction. Specifically, our approach decouples trajectory planning into two stages. In Stage 1, a shared decoder jointly generates initial trajectories for both tasks. In Stage 2, the model performs planning-specific refinement conditioned on an ego-vehicle's state. The transition between the two stages is bridged by a state predictor trained exclusively on ego-vehicle data. To address the cross-vehicle discrepancy in observational perspectives, we propose an Equivariant Context-Sharing Adapter (ECSA) before Stage 1 for improving cross-vehicle generalization of scene representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalizable Physics-Enhanced State Space Model for Long-Term Dynamics Forecasting in Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10792v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to address the problem of long-term dynamic forecasting in complex environments where data are noisy and irregularly sampled. While recent studies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these approaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term extrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics knowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in complex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical systems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization ability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially known physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system dynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a Phy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce a physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align with system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the solutions for our method.

| **[Efficient Multi-Person Motion Prediction by Lightweight Spatial and Temporal Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09446v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-person motion prediction is a highly complex task, primarily due to the dependencies on both individual past movements and the interactions between agents. Moreover, effectively modeling these interactions often incurs substantial computational costs. In this work, we propose a computationally efficient model for multi-person motion prediction by simplifying spatial and temporal interactions. Our approach begins with the design of lightweight dual branches that learn local and global representations for individual and multiple persons separately. Additionally, we introduce a novel cross-level interaction block to integrate the spatial and temporal representations from both branches. To further enhance interaction modeling, we explicitly incorporate the spatial inter-person distance embedding. With above efficient temporal and spatial design, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multiple metrics on standard datasets of CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D, and 3DPW, while significantly reducing the computational cost.

| **[GGMotion: Group Graph Dynamics-Kinematics Networks for Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07515v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges. Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in short-term motion prediction.

While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

The context itself can be static (lanes, regulatory elements, etc) or dynamic (traffic participants). This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Marginal to Joint Predictions: Evaluating Scene-Consistent Trajectory Prediction Approaches for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05254v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of automated vehicles in dynamic environments. Marginal prediction models commonly forecast each agent's future trajectories independently, often leading to sub-optimal planning decisions for an automated vehicle. In contrast, joint prediction models explicitly account for the interactions between agents, yielding socially and physically consistent predictions on a scene level. However, existing approaches differ not only in their problem formulation but also in the model architectures and implementation details used, making it difficult to compare them. In this work, we systematically investigate different approaches to joint motion prediction, including post-processing of the marginal predictions, explicitly training the model for joint predictions, and framing the problem as a generative task. We evaluate each approach in terms of prediction accuracy, multi-modality, and inference efficiency, offering a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach.

| **[Stochastic Human Motion Prediction with Memory of Action Transition and Action Characteristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04062v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better, we further propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. The demo and code are available at https://hyqlat.github.io/STABACB.github.io/.</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Temporal Continual Learning with Prior Compensation for Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04060v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Motion Prediction (HMP) aims to predict future poses at different moments according to past motion sequences. Previous approaches have treated the prediction of various moments equally, resulting in two main limitations: the learning of short-term predictions is hindered by the focus on long-term predictions, and the incorporation of prior information from past predictions into subsequent predictions is limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage training framework called Temporal Continual Learning (TCL) to address the above challenges. To better preserve prior information, we introduce the Prior Compensation Factor (PCF). We incorporate it into the model training to compensate for the lost prior information. Furthermore, we derive a more reasonable optimization objective through theoretical derivation. It is important to note that our TCL framework can be easily integrated with different HMP backbone models and adapted to various datasets and applications. Extensive experiments on four HMP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of TCL.

We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

| **[TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00420v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

| **[GeoAda: Efficiently Finetune Geometric Diffusion Models with Equivariant Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02085v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric diffusion models have shown remarkable success in molecular dynamics and structure generation. However, efficiently fine-tuning them for downstream tasks with varying geometric controls remains underexplored. In this work, we propose an SE(3)-equivariant adapter framework ( GeoAda) that enables flexible and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for controlled generative tasks without modifying the original model architecture. GeoAda introduces a structured adapter design: control signals are first encoded through coupling operators, then processed by a trainable copy of selected pretrained model layers, and finally projected back via decoupling operators followed by an equivariant zero-initialized convolution. By fine-tuning only these lightweight adapter modules, GeoAda preserves the model's geometric consistency while mitigating overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. We theoretically prove that the proposed adapters maintain SE(3)-equivariance, ensuring that the geometric inductive biases of the pretrained diffusion model remain intact during adaptation. We demonstrate the wide applicability of GeoAda across diverse geometric control types, including frame control, global control, subgraph control, and a broad range of application domains such as particle dynamics, molecular dynamics, human motion prediction, and molecule generation. Empirical results show that GeoAda achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance while preserving original task accuracy, whereas other baselines experience significant performance degradation due to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.</p></details> |  |

We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

Most of the current designs of motion prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines, which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents. Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while achieving improved performance.

A virtual agent can generate motion responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure, achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025. Homepage: https://jinyugy21.github.io/ARIG/</p></details> |
| **[Not All Frame Features Are Equal: Video-to-4D Generation via Decoupling Dynamic-Static Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08377v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the generation of dynamic 3D objects from a video has shown impressive results. Existing methods directly optimize Gaussians using whole information in frames. However, when dynamic regions are interwoven with static regions within frames, particularly if the static regions account for a large proportion, existing methods often overlook information in dynamic regions and are prone to overfitting on static regions. This leads to producing results with blurry textures. We consider that decoupling dynamic-static features to enhance dynamic representations can alleviate this issue. Thus, we propose a dynamic-static feature decoupling module (DSFD). Along temporal axes, it regards the regions of current frame features that possess significant differences relative to reference frame features as dynamic features. Conversely, the remaining parts are the static features. Then, we acquire decoupled features driven by dynamic features and current frame features. Moreover, to further enhance the dynamic representation of decoupled features from different viewpoints and ensure accurate motion prediction, we design a temporal-spatial similarity fusion module (TSSF). Along spatial axes, it adaptively selects similar information of dynamic regions. Hinging on the above, we construct a novel approach, DS4D. Experimental results verify our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in video-to-4D. In addition, the experiments on a real-world scenario dataset demonstrate its effectiveness on the 4D scene. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[Zero-Shot EEG-to-Gait Decoding via Phase-Aware Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22488v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal, phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization, during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of BCIs.</p></details> |  |

World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, long-tail scenario generation, and multimodal fusion to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality. Our results present a novel paradigm leveraging heterogeneous data sources to build efficient, generalizable world models.

| **[FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations. Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning. Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by 41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new method to achieve environment-aware safe tracking (EAST) of robot motion plans that integrates an obstacle clearance cost for path planning, a convex reachable set for robot motion prediction, and safety constraints for dynamic obstacle avoidance. EAST adapts the motion of the robot according to the locally sensed environment geometry and dynamics, leading to fast motion in wide open areas and cautious behavior in narrow passages or near moving obstacles. Our control design uses a reference governor, a virtual dynamical system that guides the robot's motion and decouples the path tracking and safety objectives. While reference governor methods have been used for safe tracking control in static environments, our key contribution is an extension to dynamic environments using convex optimization with control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Thus, our work establishes a connection between reference governor techniques and CBF techniques for safe control in dynamic environments. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world environments, featuring complex obstacle configurations and natural dynamic obstacle motion.</p></details> |  |

However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight stems from the observation that complete and reliable historical trajectory data plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate motion prediction. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm that prioritizes the reconstruction of intact historical trajectories before feeding them into the prediction modules. Our approach introduces a novel scene tokenization module to enhance the extraction and fusion of spatial and temporal features. Following this, our proposed recovery module reconstructs agents' incomplete historical trajectories by leveraging local map topology and interactions with nearby agents. The reconstructed, clean historical data is then integrated into the downstream prediction modules. Our framework is able to effectively handle missing data of varying lengths and remains robust against observation noise, while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Furthermore, our recovery module is compatible with existing prediction models, ensuring seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, and deployment in real-world autonomous vehicles confirms its practical utility. In the 2024 Waymo Motion Prediction Competition, our method, RMP-YOLO, achieves state-of-the-art performance, securing third place.</p></details> |  |

Classical robot crowd navigation methods decouple human motion prediction from robot motion planning, which neglects the closed-loop interactions between humans and robots. This lack of a model for human reactions to the robot plan (e.g. moving out of the way) can cause the robot to get stuck. Our proposed Safe and Interactive Crowd Navigation (SICNav) method is a bilevel Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that combines prediction and planning into one optimization problem, explicitly modeling interactions among agents. In this paper, we present a systems overview of the crowd navigation platform we use to deploy SICNav in previously unseen indoor and outdoor environments. We provide a preliminary analysis of the system's operation over the course of nearly 7 km of autonomous navigation over two hours in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2025 IEEE ICRA Workshop on Field Robotics (non-archival)</p></details> |

While existing models, both conventional and data-driven, address behavioral heterogeneity to some extent, they often emphasize inter-driver heterogeneity or rely on simplified assumptions, limiting their ability to capture the dynamic heterogeneity of a single driver under different driving conditions. To address this gap, we propose a novel data-driven car-following framework that systematically embeds discrete driving regimes (e.g., steady-state following, acceleration, cruising) into vehicular motion predictions. Leveraging high-resolution traffic trajectory datasets, the proposed hybrid deep learning architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units for discrete driving regime classification with Long Short-Term Memory networks for continuous kinematic prediction, unifying discrete decision-making processes and continuous vehicular dynamics to comprehensively represent inter- and intra-driver heterogeneity. Driving regimes are identified using a bottom-up segmentation algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping, ensuring robust characterization of behavioral states across diverse traffic scenarios. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the framework significantly reduces prediction errors for acceleration (maximum MSE improvement reached 58.47\%), speed, and spacing metrics while reproducing critical traffic phenomena, such as stop-and-go wave propagation and oscillatory dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features, enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82% lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model. Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.</p></details> |  |
| **[HUMOF: Human Motion Forecasting in Interactive Social Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03753v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex scenes present significant challenges for predicting human behaviour due to the abundance of interaction information, such as human-human and humanenvironment interactions. These factors complicate the analysis and understanding of human behaviour, thereby increasing the uncertainty in forecasting human motions. Existing motion prediction methods thus struggle in these complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose an effective method for human motion forecasting in interactive scenes. To achieve a comprehensive representation of interactions, we design a hierarchical interaction feature representation so that high-level features capture the overall context of the interactions, while low-level features focus on fine-grained details. Besides, we propose a coarse-to-fine interaction reasoning module that leverages both spatial and frequency perspectives to efficiently utilize hierarchical features, thereby enhancing the accuracy of motion predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across four public datasets. Code will be released when this paper is published.</p></details> |  |

The approach consists of two key steps: one-shot multimodal motion prediction to anticipate motions of dynamic obstacles and model predictive control to incorporate these predictions into the motion planning process. Motion prediction is driven by an energy-based neural network that generates high-resolution, multi-step predictions in a single operation. The prediction outcomes are further utilized to create geometric shapes formulated as mathematical constraints. Instead of treating each dynamic obstacle individually, predicted obstacles are grouped by proximity in an unsupervised way to improve performance and efficiency. The overall collision-free navigation is handled by model predictive control with a specific design for proactive dynamic obstacle avoidance. The proposed approach allows mobile robots to navigate effectively in dynamic environments. Its performance is accessed across various scenarios that represent typical warehouse settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other existing dynamic obstacle avoidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

However, common architectures such as MLPs and Transformers lack inductive biases that reflect the underlying kinematic structure of articulated systems. To this end, we propose the Neural Rodrigues Operator, a learnable generalization of the classical forward kinematics operation, designed to inject kinematics-aware inductive bias into neural computation. Building on this operator, we design the Rodrigues Network (RodriNet), a novel neural architecture specialized for processing actions. We evaluate the expressivity of our network on two synthetic tasks on kinematic and motion prediction, showing significant improvements compared to standard backbones. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in two realistic applications: (i) imitation learning on robotic benchmarks with the Diffusion Policy, and (ii) single-image 3D hand reconstruction. Our results suggest that integrating structured kinematic priors into the network architecture improves action learning in various domains.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for motion forecasting or motion generation rely solely on either prior motions or text prompts, facing limitations with precision or control, particularly over extended durations. The multi-modal nature of our approach enhances the contextual understanding of human motion, while our graph-based transformer framework effectively capture both spatial and temporal motion dynamics. As a result, our model consistently outperforms existing generative techniques in accurately predicting long-term motions. Additionally, by leveraging diffusion models' ability to capture different modes of prediction, we estimate uncertainty, significantly improving spatial awareness in human-robot interactions by incorporating zones of presence with varying confidence levels for each body joint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 - HuMoGen.

However, this approach suffers from error propagation, particularly in distant future frames. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the first AutoRegression-Free (ARFree) video prediction framework using diffusion models. Different from an autoregressive video prediction mechanism, ARFree directly predicts any future frame tuples from the context frame tuple. The proposed ARFree consists of two key components: 1) a motion prediction module that predicts a future motion using motion feature extracted from the context frame tuple; 2) a training method that improves motion continuity and contextual consistency between adjacent future frame tuples. Our experiments with two benchmark datasets show that the proposed ARFree video prediction framework outperforms several state-of-the-art video prediction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Collision Probability Estimation for Optimization-based Vehicular Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21161v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating the probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurement and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation result for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation, ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding the collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncertainty in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by a multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predicted vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature, where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided POC is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees, and present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC estimate for Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading. This algorithm is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in the presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels of uncertainty.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

For the task of test-time adaptation, the misalignment manifests as overly smoothed and unguided predictions. The smoothing settles predictions towards some average pose. Furthermore, when there are occlusions or truncations, the adaptation becomes fully unguided. To this end, we pioneer the integration of a semantics-aware motion prior for the test-time adaptation of 3D pose estimation. We leverage video understanding and a well-structured motion-text space to adapt the model motion prediction to adhere to video semantics during test time. Additionally, we incorporate a missing 2D pose completion based on the motion-text similarity. The pose completion strengthens the motion prior's guidance for occlusions and truncations. Our method significantly improves state-of-the-art 3D human pose estimation TTA techniques, with more than 12% decrease in PA-MPJPE on 3DPW and 3DHP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

We show that this limitation arises from the conventional pixel reconstruction objective, which biases models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoJAM, a novel framework that instills an effective motion prior to video generators, by encouraging the model to learn a joint appearance-motion representation. VideoJAM is composed of two complementary units. During training, we extend the objective to predict both the generated pixels and their corresponding motion from a single learned representation. During inference, we introduce Inner-Guidance, a mechanism that steers the generation toward coherent motion by leveraging the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. Notably, our framework can be applied to any video model with minimal adaptations, requiring no modifications to the training data or scaling of the model. VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence, surpassing highly competitive proprietary models while also enhancing the perceived visual quality of the generations. These findings emphasize that appearance and motion can be complementary and, when effectively integrated, enhance both the visual quality and the coherence of video generation.

Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often fail in high-variance tasks like 3D object detection due to unstable optimization and sharp minima. While recent model merging strategies based on linear mode connectivity (LMC) offer improved stability by interpolating between fine-tuned checkpoints, they are computationally expensive, requiring repeated checkpoint access and multiple forward passes. In this paper, we introduce CodeMerge, a lightweight and scalable model merging framework that bypasses these limitations by operating in a compact latent space. Instead of loading full models, CodeMerge represents each checkpoint with a low-dimensional fingerprint derived from the source model's penultimate features and constructs a key-value codebook. We compute merging coefficients using ridge leverage scores on these fingerprints, enabling efficient model composition without compromising adaptation quality. Our method achieves strong performance across challenging benchmarks, improving end-to-end 3D detection 14.9% NDS on nuScenes-C and LiDAR-based detection by over 7.6% mAP on nuScenes-to-KITTI, while benefiting downstream tasks such as online mapping, motion prediction and planning even without training.

However, linear models' expressive power and bias for real-world trajectories have not been thoroughly analyzed. We present an in-depth empirical analysis of the trade-off between model complexity and fit error in modelling object trajectories. We analyze vehicle, cyclist, and pedestrian trajectories. Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity. This suggests the feasibility of using linear trajectory models in future motion prediction systems with inherent mathematical advantages.</p></details> |  |

While many studies address either full-body pose prediction or motion trajectory prediction, only a few attempt to merge them. We propose a motion transformation technique to simultaneously predict full-body pose and trajectory key-points in a global coordinate frame. We utilize an off-the-shelf 3D human pose estimation module, a graph attention network to encode the skeleton structure, and a compact, non-autoregressive transformer suitable for real-time motion prediction for human-robot interaction and human-aware navigation. We introduce a human navigation dataset ``DARKO'' with specific focus on navigational activities that are relevant for human-aware mobile robot navigation. We perform extensive evaluation on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and our DARKO dataset. In comparison to prior work, we show that our approach is compact, real-time, and accurate in predicting human navigation motion across all datasets.

| **[APEX: Empowering LLMs with Physics-Based Task Planning for Real-time Insight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13921v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning and task planning capabilities but remain fundamentally limited in physical interaction modeling. Existing approaches integrate perception via Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or adaptive decision-making through Reinforcement Learning (RL), but they fail to capture dynamic object interactions or require task-specific training, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce APEX (Anticipatory Physics-Enhanced Execution), a framework that equips LLMs with physics-driven foresight for real-time task planning. APEX constructs structured graphs to identify and model the most relevant dynamic interactions in the environment, providing LLMs with explicit physical state updates. Simultaneously, APEX provides low-latency forward simulations of physically feasible actions, allowing LLMs to select optimal strategies based on predictive outcomes rather than static observations. We evaluate APEX on three benchmarks designed to assess perception, prediction, and decision-making: (1) Physics Reasoning Benchmark, testing causal inference and object motion prediction; (2) Tetris, evaluating whether physics-informed prediction enhances decision-making performance in long-horizon planning tasks; (3) Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance, assessing the immediate integration of perception and action feasibility analysis. APEX significantly outperforms standard LLMs and VLM-based models, demonstrating the necessity of explicit physics reasoning for bridging the gap between language-based intelligence and real-world task execution.

| **[CacheFlow: Fast Human Motion Prediction by Cached Normalizing Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13140v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many density estimation techniques for 3D human motion prediction require a significant amount of inference time, often exceeding the duration of the predicted time horizon. To address the need for faster density estimation for 3D human motion prediction, we introduce a novel flow-based method for human motion prediction called CacheFlow. Unlike previous conditional generative models that suffer from time efficiency, CacheFlow takes advantage of an unconditional flow-based generative model that transforms a Gaussian mixture into the density of future motions. The results of the computation of the flow-based generative model can be precomputed and cached. Then, for conditional prediction, we seek a mapping from historical trajectories to samples in the Gaussian mixture. This mapping can be done by a much more lightweight model, thus saving significant computation overhead compared to a typical conditional flow model. In such a two-stage fashion and by caching results from the slow flow model computation, we build our CacheFlow without loss of prediction accuracy and model expressiveness. This inference process is completed in approximately one millisecond, making it 4 times faster than previous VAE methods and 30 times faster than previous diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks such as Human3.6M and AMASS datasets. Furthermore, our method demonstrates improved density estimation accuracy and comparable prediction accuracy to a SOTA method on Human3.6M. Our code and models will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Haar Network: Enhancing human motion prediction via Haar transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12631v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 3D human pose is vital for modern computer vision and computer graphics, and its prediction has drawn attention in recent years. 3D human pose prediction aims at forecasting a human's future motion from the previous sequence. Ignoring that the arbitrariness of human motion sequences has a firm origin in transition in both temporal and spatial axes limits the performance of state-of-the-art methods, leading them to struggle with making precise predictions on complex cases, e.g., arbitrarily posing or greeting. To alleviate this problem, a network called HaarMoDic is proposed in this paper, which utilizes the 2D Haar transform to project joints to higher resolution coordinates where the network can access spatial and temporal information simultaneously. An ablation study proves that the significant contributing module within the HaarModic Network is the Multi-Resolution Haar (MR-Haar) block. Instead of mining in one of two axes or extracting separately, the MR-Haar block projects whole motion sequences to a mixed-up coordinate in higher resolution with 2D Haar Transform, allowing the network to give scope to information from both axes in different resolutions. With the MR-Haar block, the HaarMoDic network can make predictions referring to a broader range of information. Experimental results demonstrate that HaarMoDic surpasses state-of-the-art methods in every testing interval on the Human3.6M dataset in the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Planning for Autonomous Driving via Mixed Adversarial Diffusion Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12327v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a robust planning method for autonomous driving that mixes normal and adversarial agent predictions output by a diffusion model trained for motion prediction. We first train a diffusion model to learn an unbiased distribution of normal agent behaviors. We then generate a distribution of adversarial predictions by biasing the diffusion model at test time to generate predictions that are likely to collide with a candidate plan. We score plans using expected cost with respect to a mixture distribution of normal and adversarial predictions, leading to a planner that is robust against adversarial behaviors but not overly conservative when agents behave normally. Unlike current approaches, we do not use risk measures that over-weight adversarial behaviors while placing little to no weight on low-cost normal behaviors or use hard safety constraints that may not be appropriate for all driving scenarios. We show the effectiveness of our method on single-agent and multi-agent jaywalking scenarios as well as a red light violation scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

During this time, patients may experience organ motion due to breathing and other physiological factors. Predicting and modeling this motion before treatment is crucial for ensuring precise radiation delivery. However, existing pre-treatment organ motion prediction methods primarily rely on deformation analysis using principal component analysis (PCA), which is highly dependent on registration quality and struggles to capture periodic temporal dynamics for motion modeling.In this paper, we observe that organ motion prediction closely resembles an autoregressive process, a technique widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Autoregressive models predict the next token based on previous inputs, naturally aligning with our objective of predicting future organ motion phases. Building on this insight, we reformulate organ motion prediction as an autoregressive process to better capture patient-specific motion patterns. Specifically, we acquire 4D CT scans for each patient before treatment, with each sequence comprising multiple 3D CT phases. These phases are fed into the autoregressive model to predict future phases based on prior phase motion patterns. We evaluate our method on a real-world test set of 4D CT scans from 50 patients who underwent radiotherapy at our institution and a public dataset containing 4D CT scans from 20 patients (some with multiple scans), totaling over 1,300 3D CT phases. The performance in predicting the motion of the lung and heart surpasses existing benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing motion dynamics from CT images. These results highlight the potential of our method to improve pre-treatment planning in radiotherapy, enabling more precise and adaptive radiation delivery.</p></details> |  |

It enables intelligent systems, such as robots and self-driving cars, to act safely in dynamic, human-involved environments, and informs broader time-series reasoning challenges. With advances in methods, representations, and datasets, the field has seen rapid progress, reflected in quickly evolving benchmark results. Yet, when state-of-the-art methods are deployed in the real world, they often struggle to generalize to open-world conditions and fall short of deployment standards. This reveals a gap between research benchmarks, which are often idealized or ill-posed, and real-world complexity. To address this gap, this survey revisits the generalization and deployability of motion prediction models, with an emphasis on the applications of robotics, autonomous driving, and human motion. We first offer a comprehensive taxonomy of motion prediction methods, covering representations, modeling strategies, application domains, and evaluation protocols. We then study two key challenges: (1) how to push motion prediction models to be deployable to realistic deployment standards, where motion prediction does not act in a vacuum, but functions as one module of closed-loop autonomy stacks - it takes input from the localization and perception, and informs downstream planning and control. 2) how to generalize motion prediction models from limited seen scenarios/datasets to the open-world settings. Throughout the paper, we highlight critical open challenges to guide future work, aiming to recalibrate the community's efforts, fostering progress that is not only measurable but also meaningful for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial draft, 162 pages, 40 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

However, the data collection cost of such motion capture data limits the data diversity, which leads to poor generalizability to unseen motions or subjects. To address this issue, this paper proposes to enhance HMP with additional learning using estimated poses from easily available videos. The 2D poses estimated from the monocular videos are carefully transformed into motion capture-style 3D motions through our pipeline. By additional learning with the obtained motions, the HMP model is adapted to the test domain.

However, these benchmarks fail to assess whether such improvements translate to better performance when integrated into an autonomous driving stack. In this work, we systematically evaluate the interplay between state-of-the-art motion predictors and motion planners. Our results show that higher open-loop accuracy does not always correlate with better closed-loop driving behavior and that other factors, such as temporal consistency of predictions and planner compatibility, also play a critical role. Furthermore, we investigate downsized variants of these models, and, surprisingly, find that in some cases models with up to 86% fewer parameters yield comparable or even superior closed-loop driving performance.

The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 Figures, Accepted at AIRC 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose BEVWorld, a novel framework that transforms multimodal sensor inputs into a unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for holistic environment modeling. The proposed world model consists of two main components: a multi-modal tokenizer and a latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first encodes heterogeneous sensory data, and its decoder reconstructs the latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and surround-view image observations via ray-casting rendering in a self-supervised manner. This enables joint modeling and bidirectional encoding-decoding of panoramic imagery and point cloud data within a shared spatial representation. On top of this, the latent BEV sequence diffusion model performs temporally consistent forecasting of future scenes, conditioned on high-level action tokens, enabling scene-level reasoning over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BEVWorld on autonomous driving benchmarks, showcasing its capability in realistic future scene generation and its benefits for downstream tasks such as perception and motion prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Previous methods usually train separate models for these three abilities, which prevents them from learning from each other. In this paper, we propose a joint predictive agent model, named EgoAgent, that simultaneously learns to represent the world, predict future states, and take reasonable actions within a single transformer. EgoAgent introduces two innovations to learn from the causal and temporally intertwined nature of these abilities: (1) Interleaved sequential modeling of states and actions with the causal attention mechanism, and (2) A joint embedding-action-prediction architecture featuring temporal asymmetric predictor-observer branches. Integrating these designs based on JEPA, EgoAgent unifies these capabilities in a cohesive learning framework. Comprehensive evaluations of EgoAgent on representative tasks such as image classification, egocentric future state prediction, and 3D human motion prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code and trained model will be released for reproducibility.</p></details> |  |

Yet, traditional datasets are usually captured by fixed sensors mounted on a car and are susceptible to occlusion. Additionally, such an approach can precisely reconstruct the dynamic environment in the close vicinity of the measurement vehicle only, while neglecting objects that are further away. In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents. Our interactive online visualization platform and the complete dataset are publicly available at https://app.deepscenario.com, facilitating research in motion prediction, behavior modeling, and safety validation.</p></details> |  |

Currently, most approaches integrate perception, prediction, and planning modules into a fully differentiable network, promising great scalability. However, these methods typically rely on deterministic modeling of online maps in the perception module for guiding or constraining vehicle planning, which may incorporate erroneous perception information and further compromise planning safety. To address this issue, we delve into the importance of online map uncertainty for enhancing autonomous driving safety and propose a novel paradigm named UncAD. Specifically, UncAD first estimates the uncertainty of the online map in the perception module. It then leverages the uncertainty to guide motion prediction and planning modules to produce multi-modal trajectories. Finally, to achieve safer autonomous driving, UncAD proposes an uncertainty-collision-aware planning selection strategy according to the online map uncertainty to evaluate and select the best trajectory. In this study, we incorporate UncAD into various state-of-the-art (SOTA) end-to-end methods. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that integrating UncAD, with only a 1.9% increase in parameters, can reduce collision rates by up to 26% and drivable area conflict rate by up to 42%.

In contrast to previous studies, our work provides a simple mechanism to dynamically prioritize the lanes and shows that such a mechanism introduces explainability into the learning behavior of the network. Additionally, LMFormer uses the lane connection information at intersections, lane merges, and lane splits, in order to learn long-range dependency in lane structure. Moreover, we also address the issue of refining the predicted trajectories and propose an efficient method for iterative refinement through stacked transformer layers. For benchmarking, we evaluate LMFormer on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate that it achieves SOTA performance across multiple metrics. Furthermore, the Deep Scenario dataset is used to not only illustrate cross-dataset network performance but also the unification capabilities of LMFormer to train on multiple datasets and achieve better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted: Autonomous Driving Workshop, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06176v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

This paper explores the unique advantage of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR in autonomous perception. Given a single frame FMCW point cloud with radial velocity measurements, we expect that our object detector can detect the short-term future locations of objects using only the current frame sensor data and demonstrate a fast ability to respond to intermediate danger. To achieve this, we extend the standard object detection task to a novel task named predictive object detection (POD), which aims to predict the short-term future location and dimensions of objects based solely on current observations. Typically, a motion prediction task requires historical sensor information to process the temporal contexts of each object, while our detector's avoidance of multi-frame historical information enables a much faster response time to potential dangers. The core advantage of FMCW LiDAR lies in the radial velocity associated with every reflected point. We propose a novel POD framework, the core idea of which is to generate a virtual future point using a ray casting mechanism, create virtual two-frame point clouds with the current and virtual future frames, and encode these two-frame voxel features with a sparse 4D encoder. Subsequently, the 4D voxel features are separated by temporal indices and remapped into two Bird's Eye View (BEV) features: one decoded for standard current frame object detection and the other for future predictive object detection. Extensive experiments on our in-house dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art standard and predictive detection performance of the proposed POD framework.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GAMDTP, a novel graph attention-based network tailored for dynamic trajectory prediction. Specifically, we fuse the result of self attention and mamba-ssm through a gate mechanism, leveraging the strengths of both to extract features more efficiently and accurately, in each graph convolution layer. GAMDTP encodes the high-definition map(HD map) data and the agents' historical trajectory coordinates and decodes the network's output to generate the final prediction results. Additionally, recent approaches predominantly focus on dynamically fusing historical forecast results and rely on two-stage frameworks including proposal and refinement. To further enhance the performance of the two-stage frameworks we also design a scoring mechanism to evaluate the prediction quality during the proposal and refinement processes. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates that GAMDTP achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving superior accuracy in dynamic trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of non-linear programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. In order to enhance the robustness and reduce the computational burden, this paper proposes a two-layer trajectory generating algorithm for intelligent ground vehicles with convex optimization methods, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization and to improve the calculate speed of motion prediction. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets constructed by some customized search algorithms incrementally. We rigorously establish these advantages through mathematical analysis under moderate assumptions and comprehensive experimental validations. For linear vehicle models, comparative experiments with general sequential convex programming algorithms demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational efficiency in dynamic maps and the reduced final time.</p></details> |  |

However, this design introduces information loss during inter-module communication, increases computational overhead, and can lead to compounding errors. To address these challenges, recent works have proposed architectures that integrate all components into an end-to-end differentiable model, enabling holistic system optimization. This shift emphasizes data engineering over software integration, offering the potential to enhance system performance by simply scaling up training resources. In this work, we evaluate the performance of a simple end-to-end driving architecture on internal driving datasets ranging in size from 16 to 8192 hours with both open-loop metrics and closed-loop simulations. Specifically, we investigate how much additional training data is needed to achieve a target performance gain, e.g., a 5% improvement in motion prediction accuracy. By understanding the relationship between model performance and training dataset size, we aim to provide insights for data-driven decision-making in autonomous driving development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, CVPR 2025 Workshop on Autonomous Driving</p></details> |

However, retinal motion caused by physiological factors such as respiration and heartbeat significantly impacts precise needle positioning, increasing the risk of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage. This paper presents a fully autonomous robotic subretinal injection system that integrates intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) imaging and deep learning-based motion prediction to synchronize needle motion with retinal displacement. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is used to predict internal limiting membrane (ILM) motion, outperforming a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based baseline model. Additionally, a real-time registration framework aligns the needle tip position with the robot's coordinate frame. Then, a dynamic proportional speed control strategy ensures smooth and adaptive needle insertion. Experimental validation in both simulation and ex vivo open-sky porcine eyes demonstrates precise motion synchronization and successful subretinal injections. The experiment achieves a mean tracking error below 16.4 {\mu}m in pre-insertion phases. These results show the potential of AI-driven robotic assistance to improve the safety and accuracy of retinal microsurgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[L-LBVC: Long-Term Motion Estimation and Prediction for Learned Bi-Directional Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02560v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learned video compression (LVC) has shown superior performance under low-delay configuration. However, the performance of learned bi-directional video compression (LBVC) still lags behind traditional bi-directional coding. The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate long-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in large motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes a novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion estimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions. Specifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and non-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large motions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to estimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction module that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the accuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference frames during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training. Experiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets under random access configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Data Compression Conference (DCC)</p></details> |
| **[Focal Mechanism Uncertainty Quantification In Ground Motion Simulations Of Le Teil Earthquake](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01868v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the seismic safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) is essential, especially for facilities that rely on base isolation to reduce earthquake impacts. For understanding the seismic response, accurate models are key to predict the ground motions, which are generally sensitive to various factors, including earthquake source parameters like the focal mechanism, i.e., strike, dip, and rake angles. This study examines how uncertainties in these parameters affect ground motion predictions. The analysis is based on the SMATCH benchmark, which provides a standardized approach for evaluating the seismic response of the Cruas-Meysse NPP in France during the Mw 4.9 Le-Teil earthquake of 2019. A set of 27 3D high-fidelity numerical simulations was performed using a spectral-element method, each incorporating different focal mechanism variations. These simulations provide an effective approach for investigating the factors behind the exceptional ground motion observed during this event. To quantify uncertainty, the simulated ground motions were compared to recorded data using two well-established goodness-of-fit criteria: one assessing time-frequency domain characteristics and another focusing on the characterization of the ground motion signals by intensity measures. Results highlight the significant influence of focal mechanism variability on ground motion predictions, especially on the rake angle, which showed the strongest correlation with wave and intensity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Retina-Inspired Pathway to Real-Time Motion Prediction inside Image Sensors for Extreme-Edge Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01275v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to predict motion in real time is fundamental to many maneuvering activities in animals, particularly those critical for survival, such as attack and escape responses. Given its significance, it is no surprise that motion prediction in animals begins in the retina. Similarly, autonomous systems utilizing computer vision could greatly benefit from the capability to predict motion in real time. Therefore, for computer vision applications, motion prediction should be integrated directly at the camera pixel level. Towards that end, we present a retina-inspired neuromorphic framework capable of performing real-time, energy-efficient MP directly within camera pixels. Our hardware-algorithm framework, implemented using GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology, integrates key retinal MP compute blocks, including a biphasic filter, spike adder, nonlinear circuit, and a 2D array for multi-directional motion prediction. Additionally, integrating the sensor and MP compute die using a 3D Cu-Cu hybrid bonding approach improves design compactness by minimizing area usage and simplifying routing complexity. Validated on real-world object stimuli, the model delivers efficient, low-latency MP for decision-making scenarios reliant on predictive visual computation, while consuming only 18.56 pJ/MP in our mixed-signal hardware implementation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 8 figures |

The second type of redundancy reduction is obtained by self-supervised learning and applies the redundancy reduction principle to embeddings generated from augmented views of road environments. Our experiments reveal that our representation learning approach outperforms PreTraM, Traj-MAE, and GraphDINO in a semi-supervised setting.

Existing fMRI-to-video methods often focus on semantic content while overlooking spatial and motion information. However, these aspects are all essential and are processed through distinct pathways in the brain. Motivated by this, we propose DecoFuse, a novel brain-inspired framework for decoding videos from fMRI signals. It first decomposes the video into three components - semantic, spatial, and motion - then decodes each component separately before fusing them to reconstruct the video. This approach not only simplifies the complex task of video decoding by decomposing it into manageable sub-tasks, but also establishes a clearer connection between learned representations and their biological counterpart, as supported by ablation studies. Further, our experiments show significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 82.4% accuracy for semantic classification, 70.6% accuracy in spatial consistency, a 0.212 cosine similarity for motion prediction, and 21.9% 50-way accuracy for video generation. Additionally, neural encoding analyses for semantic and spatial information align with the two-streams hypothesis, further validating the distinct roles of the ventral and dorsal pathways. Overall, DecoFuse provides a strong and biologically plausible framework for fMRI-to-video decoding. Project page: https://chongjg.github.io/DecoFuse/.</p></details> |  |

Current advancements have primarily concentrated on methods for learning maps of human flow in environments where the flow is static, i.e., not assumed to change over time. In this paper we propose an online update method of the CLiFF-map (an advanced map of dynamics type that models motion patterns as velocity and orientation mixtures) to actively detect and adapt to human flow changes. As new observations are collected, our goal is to update a CLiFF-map to effectively and accurately integrate them, while retaining relevant historic motion patterns. The proposed online update method maintains a probabilistic representation in each observed location, updating parameters by continuously tracking sufficient statistics. In experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that our method is able to maintain accurate representations of human motion dynamics, contributing to high performance flow-compliant planning downstream tasks, while being orders of magnitude faster than the comparable baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Human Motion Prediction via Multi-range Decoupling Decoding with Gating-adjusting Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23381v1)** | 2025-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expressive representation of pose sequences is crucial for accurate motion modeling in human motion prediction (HMP). While recent deep learning-based methods have shown promise in learning motion representations, these methods tend to overlook the varying relevance and dependencies between historical information and future moments, with a stronger correlation for short-term predictions and weaker for distant future predictions. This limits the learning of motion representation and then hampers prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called multi-range decoupling decoding with gating-adjusting aggregation ($MD2GA$), which leverages the temporal correlations to refine motion representation learning. This approach employs a two-stage strategy for HMP. In the first stage, a multi-range decoupling decoding adeptly adjusts feature learning by decoding the shared features into distinct future lengths, where different decoders offer diverse insights into motion patterns. In the second stage, a gating-adjusting aggregation dynamically combines the diverse insights guided by input motion data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily integrated into other motion prediction methods and enhance their prediction performance.</p></details> |  |

While this is a well-established problem, prior work has mostly explored naive solutions such as fine-tuning, focusing on the motion prediction task. In this work, we explore novel adaptation strategies for differentiable autonomy stacks consisting of prediction, planning, and control, perform evaluation in closed-loop, and investigate the often-overlooked issue of catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, we introduce two simple yet effective techniques: a low-rank residual decoder (LoRD) and multi-task fine-tuning. Through experiments across three models conducted on two real-world autonomous driving datasets (nuPlan, exiD), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and highlight a significant performance gap between open-loop and closed-loop evaluation in prior approaches. Our approach improves forgetting by up to 23.33% and the closed-loop OOD driving score by 9.93% in comparison to standard fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, the traditional methods relying on physiological signal measurement are restrictive and often lack environmental context. We propose a novel approach that predicts future sequences of both hand poses and joint positions. This method integrates gaze information, historical hand motion sequences, and environmental object data, adapting dynamically to the assistive needs of the patient without prior knowledge of the intended object for grasping. Specifically, we use a vector-quantized variational autoencoder for robust hand pose encoding with an autoregressive generative transformer for effective hand motion sequence prediction. We demonstrate the usability of these novel techniques in a pilot study with healthy subjects. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we collect a dataset consisting of various types of grasp actions on different objects from multiple subjects. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully predict sequential hand movement. Especially, the gaze information shows significant enhancements in prediction capabilities, particularly with fewer input frames, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ModeSeq: Taming Sparse Multimodal Motion Prediction with Sequential Mode Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11911v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe autonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and uncalibrated mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or heuristic post-processing, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</p></details> |  |

Scene representation, as a key module in the pipeline, has traditionally relied on conventional perception, which focus on the global scene. However, in driving scenarios, human drivers typically focus only on regions that directly impact driving, which often coincide with those required for end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving method called InsightDrive is proposed, which organizes perception by language-guided scene representation. We introduce an instance-centric scene tokenizer that transforms the surrounding environment into map- and object-aware instance tokens. Scene attention language descriptions, which highlight key regions and obstacles affecting the ego vehicle's movement, are generated by a vision-language model that leverages the cognitive reasoning capabilities of foundation models. We then align scene descriptions with visual features using the vision-language model, guiding visual attention through these descriptions to give effectively scene representation. Furthermore, we employ self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to model the ego-agents and ego-map relationships to comprehensively build the topological relationships of the scene. Finally, based on scene understanding, we jointly perform motion prediction and planning. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that the proposed InsightDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end autonomous driving.

However, finger motions are highly articulated with multiple degrees of freedom, making them significantly harder to model and predict. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-inspired time-agnostic graph neural network (TA-GNN) to accurately predict human finger motions. The proposed encoder comprises a kinematic feature extractor to generate filtered velocity and acceleration and a physics-based encoder that follows linear kinematics. The model is designed to be prediction-time-agnostic so that it can seamlessly provide continuous predictions. The graph-based decoder for learning the topological motion between finger joints is designed to address the higher degree articulation of fingers. We show the superiority of our model performance in virtual reality context. This novel approach enhances finger tracking without additional sensors, enabling predictive interactions such as haptic re-targeting and improving predictive rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

We formulate a unified framework to tackle this task, and curate a challenging dataset of openable 3D objects that serves as a test bed for systematic evaluation. Our experiments benchmark methods from prior work, extended and improved methods, and simple yet effective heuristics for the S2O task. We find that turning static 3D objects into interactively openable counterparts is possible but that all methods struggle to generalize to realistic settings of the task, and we highlight promising future work directions. Our work enables efficient creation of interactive 3D objects for robotic manipulation and embodied AI tasks.</p></details> |  |

Hence, high quality and fast mapping becomes a fundamental problem. With the advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as an explicit representation with excellent rendering quality and speed, state-of-the-art (SOTA) works introduce GS to SLAM. Compared to classical pointcloud-SLAM, GS-SLAM generates photometric information by learning from input camera views and synthesize unseen views with high-quality textures. However, these GS-SLAM fail when moving objects occupy the scene that violate the static assumption of bundle adjustment. The failed updates of moving GS affects the static GS and contaminates the full map over long frames. Although some efforts have been made by concurrent works to consider moving objects for GS-SLAM, they simply detect and remove the moving regions from GS rendering ("anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM), where only the static background could benefit from GS. To this end, we propose the first real-time GS-SLAM, "DynaGSLAM'', that achieves high-quality online GS rendering, tracking, motion predictions of moving objects in dynamic scenes while jointly estimating accurate ego motion. Our DynaGSLAM outperforms SOTA static & "Anti'' dynamic GS-SLAM on three dynamic real datasets, while keeping speed and memory efficiency in practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible.

Building on top of cooperative perception, this paper explores the feasibility and effectiveness of cooperative motion prediction. Our method, CMP, takes LiDAR signals as model input to enhance tracking and prediction capabilities. Unlike previous work that focuses separately on either cooperative perception or motion prediction, our framework, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to address the unified problem where CAVs share information in both perception and prediction modules. Incorporated into our design is the unique capability to tolerate realistic V2X transmission delays, while dealing with bulky perception representations. We also propose a prediction aggregation module, which unifies the predictions obtained by different CAVs and generates the final prediction. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in cooperative perception, tracking, and motion prediction. In particular, CMP reduces the average prediction error by 12.3% compared with the strongest baseline. Our work marks a significant step forward in the cooperative capabilities of CAVs, showcasing enhanced performance in complex scenarios.

| **[Towards Motion Compensation in Autonomous Robotic Subretinal Injections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18521v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, typically treated with intravitreal injections. Emerging therapies, such as subretinal injections of stem cells, gene therapy, small molecules and RPE cells require precise delivery to avoid damaging delicate retinal structures. Robotic systems can potentially offer the necessary precision for these procedures. This paper presents a novel approach for motion compensation in robotic subretinal injections, utilizing real time Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The proposed method leverages B$^5$-scans, a rapid acquisition of small-volume OCT data, for dynamic tracking of retinal motion along the Z-axis, compensating for physiological movements such as breathing and heartbeat. Validation experiments on ex vivo porcine eyes revealed challenges in maintaining a consistent tool-to-retina distance, with deviations of up to 200 $\mu m$ for 100 $\mu m$ amplitude motions and over 80 $\mu m$ for 25 $\mu m$ amplitude motions over one minute. Subretinal injections faced additional difficulties, with phase shifts causing the needle to move off-target and inject into the vitreous. These results highlight the need for improved motion prediction and horizontal stability to enhance the accuracy and safety of robotic subretinal procedures.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEGO-Motion: Learning-Enhanced Grids with Occupancy Instance Modeling for Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07367v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable spatial and motion information plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems. However, object-level perception models struggle with handling open scenario categories and lack precise intrinsic geometry. On the other hand, occupancy-based class-agnostic methods excel in representing scenes but fail to ensure physics consistency and ignore the importance of interactions between traffic participants, hindering the model's ability to learn accurate and reliable motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel occupancy-instance modeling framework for class-agnostic motion prediction tasks, named LEGO-Motion, which incorporates instance features into Bird's Eye View (BEV) space. Our model comprises (1) a BEV encoder, (2) an Interaction-Augmented Instance Encoder, and (3) an Instance-Enhanced BEV Encoder, improving both interaction relationships and physics consistency within the model, thereby ensuring a more accurate and robust understanding of the environment. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our framework is validated on the advanced FMCW LiDAR benchmark, showcasing its practical applicability and generalization capabilities. The code will be made publicly available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PriorMotion: Generative Class-Agnostic Motion Prediction with Raster-Vector Motion Field Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04020v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable spatial and motion perception is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Recently, class-agnostic motion prediction on bird's-eye view (BEV) cell grids derived from LiDAR point clouds has gained significant attention. However, existing frameworks typically perform cell classification and motion prediction on a per-pixel basis, neglecting important motion field priors such as rigidity constraints, temporal consistency, and future interactions between agents. These limitations lead to degraded performance, particularly in sparse and distant regions. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{PriorMotion}, an innovative generative framework designed for class-agnostic motion prediction that integrates essential motion priors by modeling them as distributions within a structured latent space. Specifically, our method captures structured motion priors using raster-vector representations and employs a variational autoencoder with distinct dynamic and static components to learn future motion distributions in the latent space. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that \textbf{PriorMotion} outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both traditional metrics and our newly proposed evaluation criteria. Notably, we achieve improvements of approximately 15.24\% in accuracy for fast-moving objects, an 3.59\% increase in generalization, a reduction of 0.0163 in motion stability, and a 31.52\% reduction in prediction errors in distant regions. Further validation on FMCW LiDAR sensors confirms the robustness of our approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Controllable Motion Generation via Diffusion Modal Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02353v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in robotics due to their ability to generate multi-modal distributions of system states and behaviors. However, a key challenge remains: ensuring precise control over the generated outcomes without compromising realism. This is crucial for applications such as motion planning or trajectory forecasting, where adherence to physical constraints and task-specific objectives is essential. We propose a novel framework that enhances controllability in diffusion models by leveraging multi-modal prior distributions and enforcing strong modal coupling. This allows us to initiate the denoising process directly from distinct prior modes that correspond to different possible system behaviors, ensuring sampling to align with the training distribution. We evaluate our approach on motion prediction using the Waymo dataset and multi-task control in Maze2D environments. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms both guidance-based techniques and conditioned models with unimodal priors, achieving superior fidelity, diversity, and controllability, even in the absence of explicit conditioning. Overall, our approach provides a more reliable and scalable solution for controllable motion generation in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Data-Driven Ship Dynamics Model: Enhancing Physics-Based Motion Prediction with Parameter Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18696v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of autonomous navigation systems on ships necessitates accurate motion prediction models tailored to individual vessels. Traditional physics-based models, while grounded in hydrodynamic principles, often fail to account for ship-specific behaviors under real-world conditions. Conversely, purely data-driven models offer specificity but lack interpretability and robustness in edge cases. This study proposes a data-driven physics-based model that integrates physics-based equations with data-driven parameter optimization, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to ensure interpretability and adaptability. The model incorporates physics-based components such as 3-DoF dynamics, rudder, and propeller forces, while parameters such as resistance curve and rudder coefficients are optimized using synthetic data. By embedding domain knowledge into the parameter optimization process, the fitted model maintains physical consistency. Validation of the approach is realized with two container ships by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, predictions against ground-truth trajectories. The results demonstrate significant improvements, in predictive accuracy and reliability, of the data-driven physics-based models over baseline physics-based models tuned with traditional marine engineering practices. The fitted models capture ship-specific behaviors in diverse conditions with their predictions being, 51.6% (ship A) and 57.8% (ship B) more accurate, 72.36% (ship A) and 89.67% (ship B) more consistent.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESVO2: Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with Stereo Event Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09374v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based visual odometry is a specific branch of visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, which aims at solving tracking and mapping subproblems (typically in parallel), by exploiting the special working principles of neuromorphic (i.e., event-based) cameras. Due to the motion-dependent nature of event data, explicit data association (i.e., feature matching) under large-baseline view-point changes is difficult to establish, making direct methods a more rational choice. However, state-of-the-art direct methods are limited by the high computational complexity of the mapping sub-problem and the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in certain degrees of freedom (DoF) in rotation. In this paper, we tackle these issues by building an event-based stereo visual-inertial odometry system on top of a direct pipeline. Specifically, to speed up the mapping operation, we propose an efficient strategy for sampling contour points according to the local dynamics of events. The mapping performance is also improved in terms of structure completeness and local smoothness by merging the temporal stereo and static stereo results. To circumvent the degeneracy of camera pose tracking in recovering the pitch and yaw components of general 6-DoF motion, we introduce IMU measurements as motion priors via pre-integration. To this end, a compact back-end is proposed for continuously updating the IMU bias and predicting the linear velocity, enabling an accurate motion prediction for camera pose tracking. The resulting system scales well with modern high-resolution event cameras and leads to better global positioning accuracy in large-scale outdoor environments. Extensive evaluations on five publicly available datasets featuring different resolutions and scenarios justify the superior performance of the proposed system against five state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite the high accuracy of state-of-the-art models, their computational complexity limits practical deployment in real-world robotic applications. In this work, we enhance human motion forecasting for handover tasks by leveraging siMLPe [1], a lightweight yet powerful architecture, and introducing key improvements. Our approach, named IntentMotion incorporates intention-aware conditioning, task-specific loss functions, and a novel intention classifier, significantly improving motion prediction accuracy while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces body loss error by over 50%, achieves 200x faster inference, and requires only 3% of the parameters compared to existing state-of-the-art HMP models. These advancements establish our framework as a highly efficient and scalable solution for real-time human-robot interaction.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Stochasticity in Motion: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01628v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is crucial for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[SmartPretrain: Model-Agnostic and Dataset-Agnostic Representation Learning for Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08669v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future motion of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to operate safely in dynamic, human-robot-mixed environments. However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

While humans inherently possess the requisite skills to navigate this issue, it proves to be markedly more challenging for machines to emulate. To bridge the gap, we propose the Human-like Vision and Inference System (HVIS) for human motion prediction, which is designed to emulate human observation and forecast future movements. HVIS comprises two components: the human-like vision encode (HVE) module and the human-like motion inference (HMI) module. The HVE module mimics and refines the human visual process, incorporating a retina-analog component that captures spatiotemporal information separately to avoid unnecessary crosstalk. Additionally, a visual cortex-analogy component is designed to hierarchically extract and treat complex motion features, focusing on both global and local features of human poses. The HMI is employed to simulate the multi-stage learning model of the human brain. The spontaneous learning network simulates the neuronal fracture generation process for the adversarial generation of future motions. Subsequently, the deliberate learning network is optimized for hard-to-train joints to prevent misleading learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods by 19.8% on Human3.6M, 15.7% on CMU Mocap, and 11.1% on G3D.</p></details> |  |

Human motion prediction focuses on forecasting future poses and movements from historical data, addressing challenges like nonlinear dynamics, occlusions, and motion style variations. Reconstruction aims to recover accurate 3D human body movements from visual inputs, often leveraging transformer-based architectures, diffusion models, and physical consistency losses to handle noise and complex poses. Motion generation synthesizes realistic and diverse motions from action labels, textual descriptions, or environmental constraints, with applications in robotics, gaming, and virtual avatars. Additionally, text-to-motion generation and human-object interaction modeling have gained attention, enabling fine-grained and context-aware motion synthesis for augmented reality and robotics. This review highlights key methodologies, datasets, challenges, and future research directions driving progress in these fields.</p></details> | Tech report |

Our study of marine vessel (in our case Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV)) dynamics influenced by strong wave motion has resulted in a novel nonlinear mathematical USV model with 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is required for precise USV state estimation and motion prediction. The proposed state estimation and prediction approach fuses data from multiple sensors onboard the UAV and the USV to enable redundancy and robustness under varying weather conditions of real-world applications. The proposed approach provides estimated states of the USV with 6 DOFs and predicts its future states to enable tight control of both vehicles on a receding control horizon. The proposed approach was extensively tested in the realistic Gazebo simulator and successfully experimentally validated in many real-world experiments representing different application scenarios, including agile landing on an oscillating and moving USV. A comparative study indicates that the proposed approach significantly surpassed the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we introduce the \textbf{M}otion-priors \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{MCDM}), which utilizes both archived and current clip motion priors to enhance motion prediction and ensure temporal consistency. The model consists of three key elements: (1) an archived-clip motion-prior that incorporates historical frames and a reference frame to preserve identity and context; (2) a present-clip motion-prior diffusion model that captures multimodal causality for accurate predictions of head movements, lip sync, and expressions; and (3) a memory-efficient temporal attention mechanism that mitigates error accumulation by dynamically storing and updating motion features. We also release the \textbf{TalkingFace-Wild} dataset, a multilingual collection of over 200 hours of footage across 10 languages. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MCDM in maintaining identity and motion continuity for long-term TalkingFace generation. Code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11172v3)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code is made publicly available: https://github.com/valeoai/MF_aWTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to ICRA2025</p></details> |

Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning.

Meanwhile, Radar-based solutions remain robust but often suffer from limited vertical resolution and simplistic motion models. Existing Kalman filter-based approaches also rely on fixed noise covariance, hampering adaptability when objects make sudden maneuvers. We propose Bayes-4DRTrack, a 4D Radar-based MOT framework that adopts a transformer-based motion prediction network to capture nonlinear motion dynamics and employs Bayesian approximation in both detection and prediction steps. Moreover, our two-stage data association leverages Doppler measurements to better distinguish closely spaced targets. Evaluated on the K-Radar dataset (including adverse weather scenarios), Bayes-4DRTrack demonstrates a 5.7% gain in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (AMOTA) over methods with traditional motion models and fixed noise covariance. These results showcase enhanced robustness and accuracy in demanding, real-world conditions.</p></details> | 6pages, 4 figures |

An important field of research is the generation of point cloud maps, referring to the topic of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). As most recent developments do not include global position data, the resulting point cloud maps suffer from internal distortion and missing georeferencing, preventing their use for map-based localization approaches. Therefore, we propose FlexCloud for an automatic georeferencing of point cloud maps created from SLAM. Our approach is designed to work modularly with different SLAM methods, utilizing only the generated local point cloud map and its odometry. Using the corresponding GNSS positions enables direct georeferencing without additional control points. By leveraging a 3D rubber-sheet transformation, we can correct distortions within the map caused by long-term drift while maintaining its structure. Our approach enables the creation of consistent, globally referenced point cloud maps from data collected by a mobile mapping system (MMS).

The primary challenge in next-frame prediction lies in effectively capturing and processing both spatial and temporal information from previous video sequences. The transformer architecture, known for its prowess in handling sequence data, has made remarkable progress in this domain. However, transformer-based next-frame prediction models face notable issues: (a) The multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism requires the input embedding to be split into $N$ chunks, where $N$ is the number of heads. Each segment captures only a fraction of the original embeddings information, which distorts the representation of the embedding in the latent space, resulting in a semantic dilution problem; (b) These models predict the embeddings of the next frames rather than the frames themselves, but the loss function based on the errors of the reconstructed frames, not the predicted embeddings -- this creates a discrepancy between the training objective and the model output. We propose a Semantic Concentration Multi-Head Self-Attention (SCMHSA) architecture, which effectively mitigates semantic dilution in transformer-based next-frame prediction. Additionally, we introduce a loss function that optimizes SCMHSA in the latent space, aligning the training objective more closely with the model output. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the original transformer-based predictors.</p></details> |  |

Most recent studies have concentrated on generating motion sequences based on text prompts, commonly referred to as text-to-motion generation. However, the bidirectional generation of motion and text, enabling tasks such as motion-to-text alongside text-to-motion, has been largely unexplored. This capability is essential for aligning diverse modalities and supports unconditional generation. In this paper, we introduce PackDiT, the first diffusion-based generative model capable of performing various tasks simultaneously, including motion generation, motion prediction, text generation, text-to-motion, motion-to-text, and joint motion-text generation. Our core innovation leverages mutual blocks to integrate multiple diffusion transformers (DiTs) across different modalities seamlessly. We train PackDiT on the HumanML3D dataset, achieving state-of-the-art text-to-motion performance with an FID score of 0.106, along with superior results in motion prediction and in-between tasks. Our experiments further demonstrate that diffusion models are effective for motion-to-text generation, achieving performance comparable to that of autoregressive models.</p></details> |  |
